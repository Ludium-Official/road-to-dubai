# Copy and Clone

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basic concepts of Copy and Clone Traits and their differences
- Understand the requirements for implementing Copy and Clone traits
- Understand the relationship between ownership model and Copy, Clone
- Learn how to appropriately use Copy and Clone

## Copy Trait

The Copy trait provides the simplest way to duplicate values. It is used for types where simple bitwise copy is sufficient enough.

### Characteristics of Copy Trait

1. Marker Trait: Copy is a marker trait that has no methods of its own
2. Implicit Copying: Types that implement Copy are implicitly copied during assignment or function calls (can be approximately understood as shallow copying)
3. Clone Dependency: The Copy trait depends on the Clone trait (i.e., it's a Super-Trait) (To implement Copy trait, Clone trait must be implemented)

### Copy Implementation Restrictions

Not all types can implement Copy. Copy cannot be implemented in the following cases: types that implement the `Drop` trait

Therefore, types containing heap-allocated data (e.g., `String`, `Vec<T>`) cannot implement Copy. This is because it would make the ownership system ambiguous.

```rust
struct NoCopy;

impl Drop for NoCopy {
    fn drop(&mut self) {}
}

// Compilation error: Cannot implement both Copy and Drop
// impl Copy for NoCopy {}
```

## Clone Trait

The Clone trait provides a more flexible method of duplication than Copy. Complex types including heap-allocated data can implement Clone.

### Characteristics of Clone Trait

1. Explicit Cloning: Must explicitly call the `clone()` method to create a copy
2. Deep Copy Possible: Can completely clone heap-allocated data into a new instance
3. Super-trait of Copy: Clone must be implemented to implement Copy

```rust
#[derive(Clone)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}

let person1 = Person {
    name: String::from("Alice"),
    age: 30,
};

let person2 = person1.clone();
```

## Practice in VSCode

1. Open VSCode and create a new Rust project: `cargo new copy_clone_demo`
2. Write the following code in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Copy, Clone)]
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Line {
    start: Point,
    end: Point,
}

fn main() {
    let p1 = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
    let p2 = p1;  // Copy
    println!("p1: {:?}, p2: {:?}", p1, p2);

    let l1 = Line { start: Point { x: 0, y: 0 }, end: Point { x: 5, y: 5 } };
    let l2 = l1.clone();  // Clone
    println!("l1: {:?}", l1);
    println!("l2: {:?}", l2);
}
```

3. Compile and run the code using the `cargo run` command in the terminal.

## Test Code

Here's the test code to verify that the example code works correctly:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_point_copy() {
        let p1 = Point { x: 1, y: 2 };
        let p2 = p1;
        assert_eq!(p1.x, p2.x);
        assert_eq!(p1.y, p2.y);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_line_clone() {
        let l1 = Line {
            start: Point { x: 0, y: 0 },
            end: Point { x: 5, y: 5 },
        };
        let l2 = l1.clone();
        assert_eq!(l1.start.x, l2.start.x);
        assert_eq!(l1.start.y, l2.start.y);
        assert_eq!(l1.end.x, l2.end.x);
        assert_eq!(l1.end.y, l2.end.y);
    }
}
```

You can add this test code to the end of your `src/main.rs` file and run the tests using the `cargo test` command.
