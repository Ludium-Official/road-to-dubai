## 1.x Version Compatibility
v1.0.0-beta says it will provide an easy upgrade path and compatibility with previous versions to all future 1.x versions
- https://medium.com/cosmwasm/its-showtime-3feb474fe183

CosmWasm v1.0.0-beta comes with the code of the entire stack and is compatible with `wasmd`v0.20.0, `cw-plus`v0.10.0, `cosmjs`v0.26.0, and `cosmos-sdk`v0.42.10.

## Cosmwasm
Since Cosmwasm 1.0, the contract-host interface has not changed in an innovative way. Furthermore, the Cosmwasm 2.0 contract remains compatible at the wasm interface level.

## Cosmwasm 1.4
Contracts using `cosmwasm-std` 1.4.0 can be distributed to all CosmWasm 1.x chains. By activating the cargo function cosmwasm_1_4, you can unlock functions that are only available in the 1.4 chain.
- CosmWasm 1.4 is available in wasmd 0.42 (Cosmos SDK 0.47 compatible).

## Cosmwasm 1.5
CosmWasm 1.5 will be embedded in the upcoming wasmd 0.44.

## Cosmwasm 2.0
CosmWasm 2.0 will be shipped as part of wasmd 0.51
- Existing contracts compiled with cosmwasm-std ^1.0.0 continue to run as before on chains with wasmvm 2.0.
- Contracts compiled with cosmwasm-std ^2.0.0 do run on chains with wasmvm 1.x or 2.0. This way, it does not matter in which order you upgrade the chain or contracts.
