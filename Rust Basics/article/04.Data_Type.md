# Data Type

## Learning objectives
- Understand the basic data type of Rust.
- Understand The difference between the scalar type and the composite type.
- Understand Rust's type reasoning capabilities.

## Inferring Rust's Type

Rust has powerful type inference capabilities. This means that in many cases, the compiler can infer the type from the context without explicitly specifying the type by the programmer.

For example:

```rust
let x = 5; // Compiler deduces x to i32
lety = 2.0; // Compiler deduces y to f64
```

However, sometimes you have to explicitly specify the type:

```rust
let guess = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

In this case, the compiler does not know which number type to parse, resulting in an error:

```
error[E0282]: type annotations needed
--> src/main.rs:2:9
|
2 | let guess = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
| ^^^^^
| cannot infer type for `_`
| consider giving `guess` a type
```

In this case, you must explicitly specify the type:

```rust
let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
```

## Scalar types

A scalar is a type represented by one value, and Rust has four scalar types: integer, floating-point numbers, boolean, and letters.

### Water Purification Type

As for the integer type, various types may be used depending on signed/unsigned and the number of bits.

| Length | signed | unsigned | 
|------|-----------|-----------|
| 8-bit | i8 | u8 |
| 16-bit | i16 | u16 |
| 32-bit | i32 | u32 |
| 64-bit | i64 | u64 |
| 128-bit | i128 | u128 |
| arch | isize | usize |

Here, the type of 'isize' and 'usize' is determined by the computer architecture in which the program operates. If it is a 64-bit architecture, it is 64 bits.

### Floating Point Type

Rust has two floating point types: `f32` and `f64`.

```rust
fn main() {
let x = 2.0; // f64
let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

`f64` is the basic type, and more precise results can be achieved at almost the same speed as `f32` in modern CPUs.

### Boolean type

Like most other languages, the boolean type can only have one value in Rust, either `true` or `false`.

```rust
fn main() {
let t = true;
let f: bol = false; // explicit type
}
```

### Character Type

Rust also supports characters. Rust's `char` type is a value that represents Unicode Scalar, which enables more expressions than ASCII. Characters with accents, characters in Korean/Chinese/Japanese tables, emoticons, and spaces with zero width can all be used in Rust as `char` types.

```rust
let c: char = 'z';
let z = 'â„¤';
let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
```

`char` literal is specified in small quotes and does not use large quotes unlike string literal.

## Complex Type

Composite types can combine different types of various values into one type. Rust has two basic composite types, each a tuple and an array.

### Tuple type

Tuple is a common method of combining several values of various types into one composite type.

```rust
fn main() {
let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

In order to get the tuple value out, the task of rescuing and disassembling the tuple must be carried out:

```rust
fn main() {
let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
let (x, y, z) = tup;
println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

In addition to structural breakdown, we can directly access the elements of the tuple by indexing the values we want to access after the period (.):

```rust
fn main() {
let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
let five_hundred = x.0;
let six_point_four = x.1;
let one = x.2;
}
```

### Arrangement

An array, unlike a tuple, must have all elements of the same type. The difference between Rust's arrangement and that of some other languages is that in Rust, the arrangement has a fixed length: once declared, they do not grow or become smaller in size.

```rust
fn main() {
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

Since the arrangement is fixed in size unlike the vector type, it is useful for dealing with a list of fixed elements that do not change.

To access elements in an array:

```rust
fn main() {
let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let first = a[0];
let second = a[1];
}
```

## Practice in VSCode

1. Open VSCode and create a new Rust project: `cargo new data_types`
2. Write the following code in the file `src/main.rs`:

```rust
fn main() {
// an integer type
let x: i32 = 42;
println!("x: {}", x);

// floating point
let y: f64 = 3.14;
println!("y: {}", y);

// boolean
let t: bool = true;
println!("t: {}", t);

// Texting
let c: char = 'ðŸ¦€';
println!("c: {}", c);

// Tuple
let tup: (i32, f64, char) = (500, 6.4, 'A');
let (a, b, d) = tup;
println!("a: {}, b: {}, d: {}", a, b, d);

// Arrangement
let arr: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
println!("arr[0]: {}, arr[4]: {}", arr[0], arr[4]);
}
```

3. Compile and execute the code by executing the `cargo run` command at the terminal.

## Test Code

The test code to verify that the example code is working correctly is as follows:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
#[test]
fn test_integer() {
let x: i32 = 42;
assert_eq!(x, 42);
}

#[test]
fn test_float() {
let y: f64 = 3.14;
assert!((y - 3.14).abs() < f64::EPSILON);
}

#[test]
fn test_boolean() {
let t: bool = true;
assert_eq!(t, true);
}

#[test]
fn test_char() {
let c: char = 'ðŸ¦€';
assert_eq!(c, 'ðŸ¦€');
}

#[test]
fn test_tuple() {
let tup: (i32, f64, char) = (500, 6.4, 'A');
assert_eq!(tup.0, 500);
assert!((tup.1 - 6.4).abs() < f64::EPSILON);
assert_eq!(tup.2, 'A');
}

#[test]
fn test_array() {
let arr: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
assert_eq!(arr[0], 1);
assert_eq!(arr[4], 5);
}
}
```

You can add this test code to the end of the file `src/main.rs` and run the command `cargo test` to perform the test. If all tests pass, it can be confirmed that the example code has been written correctly.
