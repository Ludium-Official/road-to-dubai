# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Using Functional Programming

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the basic concepts and cycles of Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- Identify how characteristics of Functional Programming (FP) benefit TDD
- Learn how to apply TDD in functional style through practical examples

## 1. Synergy between Functional Programming and TDD

Functional programming complements TDD well with the following characteristics:

1. **Pure Functions**: Always returns the same output for the same input, making tests predictable and repeatable.
2. **Immutability**: No state changes minimize interference between tests.
3. **Explicit Data Flow**: Clear function inputs and outputs make it easy to write test cases.
4. **Composability**: Complex behaviors can be created by combining small functions, making it easy to construct various levels of tests from unit tests to integration tests.

While business logic functions may need continuous testing, well-designed pure functions allow for robust logic composition with just one-time testing!

## 2. TDD Cycle in Functional Style

TDD typically follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle. Using functional programming makes this cycle more effective:

1. **Red**: Write a failing test
   - First define the function signature (input and output types)
   - Explicitly describe expected behavior

2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass the test
   - Implement as pure functions to minimize side effects
   - Break down into smallest possible function units

3. **Refactor**: Remove duplication, improve code
   - Use higher-order functions to eliminate duplication
   - Use immutable data structures to prevent side effects during refactoring

## 3. Practical Example: Simple Calculator Implementation

Let's implement a simple calculator using TDD in functional style.

### 3.1 Implementing Addition

First, let's write a test for addition functionality:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_add() {
        assert_eq!(add(2, 3), 5);
        assert_eq!(add(-1, 1), 0);
        assert_eq!(add(0, 0), 0);
    }
}
```

Now write minimal code to pass this test:

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

### 3.2 Adding Multiplication

Add test for multiplication functionality:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_multiply() {
    assert_eq!(multiply(2, 3), 6);
    assert_eq!(multiply(-1, 1), -1);
    assert_eq!(multiply(0, 5), 0);
}
```

Write code to pass this test:

```rust
fn multiply(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a * b
}
```

### 3.3 Refactoring: Introducing Higher-Order Functions

Now let's abstract addition and multiplication operations into a higher-order function:

```rust
fn operate<F>(a: i32, b: i32, op: F) -> i32
where
    F: Fn(i32, i32) -> i32,
{
    op(a, b)
}

fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    operate(a, b, |x, y| x + y)
}

fn multiply(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    operate(a, b, |x, y| x * y)
}
```

This approach allows reuse of the `operate` function when adding new operations, reducing code duplication.

Rust's attribute system makes it easy to write tests, making it well-suited for the TDD paradigm.

## 4. Benefits of Functional TDD

1. **Testability**: Pure functions are easy to test and rarely need mocks or stubs
2. **Refactoring Safety**: Immutability and pure functions minimize side effects during refactoring
3. **Parallel Testing**: Pure functions don't share state, enabling parallel test execution
4. **Documentation**: Functional code is self-documenting, and tests serve as good documentation
5. **Bug Reduction**: Immutability and pure functions reduce state-related bugs
