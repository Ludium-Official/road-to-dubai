# Enumerations

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept and usage of enumerations
- Identify the differences between enums and structs
- Learn the necessity and usage of the Option enum

## Defining Enumerations

Enumerations provide a way to indicate that a value is one of a possible set of values. For example, IP addresses can be either IPv4 or IPv6. In Rust, this can be expressed as follows:

```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
```
V4 and V6 are called variants of the enumeration.
Now IpAddrKind becomes a custom data type that can be used anywhere in the code.
As this code shows, enum variants can hold any kind of data: strings, numeric types, structs, and even other enums.

## Enum Values

Instances of an enum can be created as follows:

```rust
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
```

Enums can also be used as function parameters:

```rust
fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}

route(IpAddrKind::V4);
route(IpAddrKind::V6);
```

## Enums vs Structs

Example using structs:
```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}

struct IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind,
    address: String,
}

let home = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
    address: String::from("127.0.0.1"),
};

let loopback = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
    address: String::from("::1"),
};
```

Example using enums:
```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(String),
    V6(String),
} 

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));
let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

This method is more concise than using structs. Additionally, each variant can have different types and amounts of associated data:

```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(u8, u8, u8, u8), // More flexible than binding to a single address variable
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);
let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

## Enum Methods

Like structs, enums can have methods defined using the `impl` block:

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

impl Message {
    fn call(&self) {
        // Method body
    }
}

let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));
m.call();
```

## The Option Enum

Rust's standard library defines the `Option` enum. This enum is used to replace the concept of null values.

The Need for `Option`
Rust doesn't directly support null values. Instead, it uses Option<T> to express the presence or absence of a value. This provides the following benefits:

Explicit null checks: Developers must explicitly handle null possibilities.
Type safety: Prevents runtime errors from null references at compile time.
Clear expression of intent: Explicitly expresses through the type system that a value might be absent.

`Option` is implemented as an enum as follows:

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
```

`Option<T>` allows for safely handling situations where a value may or may not exist:

```rust
let some_number = Some(5);
let some_char = Some('e');

let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;
```

`Option<T>` and `T` are different types, so the compiler prevents using an `Option<T>` value as if it were a valid value. This helps prevent errors caused by null values.

Let's look at the components of `Option`:

Some(T): Indicates the presence of a value and contains that value.
None: Indicates the absence of a value.

Some is used when a value exists:
```rust
let x: Option<i32> = Some(5);
let name: Option<String> = Some(String::from("Alice"));
```

Benefits of using Some:
- Explicitly expresses the presence of a value
- Provides type safety
- Allows the compiler to check if all cases are handled

None indicates the absence of a value:
```rust
let y: Option<i32> = None;
let empty_name: Option<String> = None;
```

Benefits of using None:
- Prevents null reference errors by replacing null
- Forces explicit handling of value absence
- Enables checking for possible value absence at compile time

## Practice in VSCode

1. Open VSCode and create a new Rust project: `cargo new enums_demo`
2. Write the following code in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
enum IpAddr {
    V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
    V6(String),
}

fn main() {
    let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);
    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));

    print_ip_addr(&home);
    print_ip_addr(&loopback);
}

fn print_ip_addr(ip: &IpAddr) {
    match ip {
        IpAddr::V4(a, b, c, d) => println!("IPv4 Address: {}.{}.{}.{}", a, b, c, d),
        IpAddr::V6(addr) => println!("IPv6 Address: {}", addr),
    }
}
```

3. Compile and run the code by executing `cargo run` in the terminal.

## Test Code

Here's test code to verify that the example code works correctly:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_ipv4() {
        let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);
        match home {
            IpAddr::V4(a, b, c, d) => {
                assert_eq!(a, 127);
                assert_eq!(b, 0);
                assert_eq!(c, 0);
                assert_eq!(d, 1);
            },
            _ => panic!("Expected IPv4"),
        }
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_ipv6() {
        let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
        match loopback {
            IpAddr::V6(addr) => assert_eq!(addr, "::1"),
            _ => panic!("Expected IPv6"),
        }
    }
}
```

You can add this test code to the end of your `src/main.rs` file and run `cargo test` to perform the tests. If all tests pass, you can confirm that the example code is written correctly.
