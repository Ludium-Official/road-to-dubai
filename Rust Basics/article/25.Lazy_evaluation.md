## Concept of Lazy Evaluation

Lazy evaluation is a strategy that delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is actually needed. This helps avoid unnecessary calculations, enables handling of infinite data structures, and helps optimize performance.

### Need for Lazy Evaluation

1. **Performance Optimization**: Conserve resources by performing only necessary calculations
2. **Infinite Sequences**: Handle theoretically infinite data structures
3. **Side Effect Control**: Manage side effects by controlling evaluation order
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Load only required data into memory

## Implementing Lazy Evaluation in Rust

While Rust uses strict evaluation by default, lazy evaluation can be implemented using the Iterator trait and closures.

### Lazy Evaluation Using Iterator

```rust
let numbers = 1..;
let even_squares = numbers
    .filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0)
    .map(|x| x * x)
    .take(5);

for num in even_squares {
    println!("{}", num);
}
```

In this example, `1..` creates an infinite sequence starting from 1, but due to `take(5)`, only the first 5 even squares are actually calculated.

### Lazy Evaluation Using Closures

```rust
fn lazy_fibonacci() -> impl Fn(usize) -> u64 {
    move |n| {
        let mut a = 0;
        let mut b = 1;
        for _ in 0..n {
            let temp = a;
            a = b;
            b = temp + b;
        }
        a
    }
}

fn main() {
    let fib = lazy_fibonacci();
    println!("10th Fibonacci number: {}", fib(10));
}
```

In this example, the `lazy_fibonacci` function returns a closure that calculates Fibonacci numbers. The actual calculation only occurs when the closure is called.

## Advantages of Lazy Evaluation

Advantages:
1. **Avoid Unnecessary Calculations**: Conserve resources by calculating only when needed
2. **Handle Infinite Data Structures**: Work with infinite sequences and data structures
3. **Optimize Memory Usage**: Minimize memory usage by loading only required data
4. **Concise Expression of Complex Algorithms**: Improve code readability and maintainability

## Lazy Evaluation Examples in Rust Standard Library

The `std::iter` module in Rust provides various lazy evaluation methods:

```rust
let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = numbers.iter()
    .filter(|&&x| x % 2 == 0)
    .map(|&x| x * x)
    .sum::<i32>();

println!("Sum of squares of even numbers: {}", sum);
```

Here, `filter` and `map` operations aren't actually executed until `sum` is called.

## Practice in VSCode

1. Open VSCode and create a new Rust project: `cargo new rust_lazy_eval`
2. Write the following code in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
struct Fibonacci {
    curr: u64,
    next: u64,
}

impl Iterator for Fibonacci {
    type Item = u64;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        let new_next = self.curr + self.next;
        self.curr = self.next;
        self.next = new_next;
        Some(self.curr)
    }
}

fn fibonacci() -> Fibonacci {
    Fibonacci { curr: 0, next: 1 }
}

fn main() {
    let fib = fibonacci().take(10);
    for num in fib {
        println!("{}", num);
    }
}
```

3. Compile and run the code using the `cargo run` command in the terminal.

## Test Code

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_fibonacci() {
        let fib: Vec<u64> = fibonacci().take(10).collect();
        assert_eq!(fib, vec![1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_lazy_evaluation() {
        let mut iter = fibonacci();
        assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(1));
        assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(1));
        assert_eq!(iter.next(), Some(2));
    }
}
```
