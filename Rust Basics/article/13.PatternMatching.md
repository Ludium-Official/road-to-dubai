## Basic Concepts of Pattern Matching

Pattern matching in Rust is a powerful and flexible feature that allows for decomposing complex data structures and expressing conditional logic concisely. It is tightly integrated with Rust's type system, enabling many errors to be caught at compile time.

Pattern matching is a way to analyze the structure of values and execute code based on that analysis. It's more expressive than simple conditionals and particularly useful when dealing with complex data structures.

### Basic Syntax

The basic form of pattern matching is the `match` expression:

```rust
match value {
    pattern1 => expression1,
    pattern2 => expression2,
    _ => default_expression,
}
```

Here, `value` is the value to match against, `pattern1`, `pattern2` etc. are patterns that can be matched. `_` is a wildcard pattern that covers all remaining cases.
If there are variables in the pattern, they "capture" parts of the matching value and bind them. This allows easy access and use of specific parts of the matched value.

```rust
let x = 5;

match x {
    n @ 1..=5 => println!("Got a number between 1 and 5: {}", n),
    n => println!("Got something else: {}", n),
}
```
n @ 1..=5 means that if the value is between 1 and 5, it will be bound to n. Note that this value binding is also subject to ownership rules and performs a move. If the Copy trait isn't implemented, this will perform a move:

```rust
    let s = String::from("hello");

    let x = match s {
        x => x,
    };
        
    println!("{}",s); // Compilation error

    let s = String::from("hello");

    match &s {
        x => println!("Got: {}", x),
    }

    println!("Original: {}", s);  // This is possible

    let mut x = 5;

    match x {
        ref mut mr => println!("Got a mutable reference to {}", mr),
    }

    println!("x is still {}", x);  // This is possible
```
Therefore, you need to either pass a reference or declare the match with the ref keyword.

## Various Pattern Matching Techniques

### 1. Literal Matching

The simplest form of pattern matching, comparing directly with literal values.

```rust
let x = 1;

match x {
    1 => println!("one"),
    2 => println!("two"),
    3 => println!("three"),
    _ => println!("anything"),
}
```

### 2. Range Matching

You can match ranges of values. Since Rust 1.26, the inclusive range syntax `..=` was introduced.

```rust
let x = 5;

match x {
    1..=5 => println!("one through five"),
    _ => println!("something else"),
}
```

### 3. Struct Decomposition

You can match individual fields of structs.

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

let p = Point { x: 0, y: 7 };

match p {
    Point { x, y: 0 } => println!("On the x axis at {}", x),
    Point { x: 0, y } => println!("On the y axis at {}", y),
    Point { x, y } => println!("On neither axis: ({}, {})", x, y),
}
```

### 4. Enum Matching

You can match each variant of an enum, which is a very common pattern in Rust.

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

let msg = Message::ChangeColor(0, 160, 255);

match msg {
    Message::Quit => println!("Quit"),
    Message::Move { x, y } => println!("Move to ({}, {})", x, y),
    Message::Write(text) => println!("Text message: {}", text),
    Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => println!("Change color to ({}, {}, {})", r, g, b),
}
```

## Functional Programming and Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is one of the core concepts in functional programming. Rust's pattern matching strongly supports the functional programming paradigm.

1. **Data Decomposition**: Easily decompose complex data structures and extract needed parts.

2. **Pattern-Based Function Definition**: Define function arguments as patterns for clearer and safer code.

3. **Recursive Functions**: Clearly distinguish between base cases and recursive cases in recursive functions.

4. **Option and Result Handling**: Elegantly handle `Option` and `Result` types commonly used in functional programming.

For example, you can write a recursive function to process a list like this:

```rust
enum List<T> {
    Cons(T, Box<List<T>>),
    Nil,
}

fn sum_list(list: List<i32>) -> i32 {
    match list {
        List::Nil => 0,
        List::Cons(head, tail) => head + sum_list(*tail),
    }
}
```

In this example, pattern matching is used to decompose the list structure and clearly distinguish between the base case and recursive case.

## Interaction Between Pattern Matching and Type System

Rust's pattern matching is tightly integrated with the type system, allowing many errors to be caught at compile time.

1. **Pattern Completeness Check**: The compiler checks if a `match` expression handles all possible cases.

2. **Type Inference**: Pattern matching helps with type inference. For example, when decomposing tuples, the type of each element can be inferred.

3. **Type Safety**: Pattern matching contributes to type safety. Attempting to match values of incorrect types results in compile errors.

These characteristics greatly enhance the safety and reliability of Rust code.

## Practice in VS Code

Let's practice various pattern matching features directly in VS Code.

1. Open VSCode and create a new Rust project: `cargo new patterns_demo`
2. Write the following code in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}

fn process_message(msg: Message) {
    match msg {
        Message::Quit => println!("Quitting"),
        Message::Move { x, y } => println!("Moving to ({}, {})", x, y),
        Message::Write(text) if text.len() < 10 => println!("Short message: {}", text),
        Message::Write(text) => println!("Long message: {}", text),
        Message::ChangeColor(r, g, b) => println!("Changing color to ({}, {}, {})", r, g, b),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let messages = vec![
        Message::Quit,
        Message::Move { x: 10, y: 20 },
        Message::Write(String::from("Hello")),
        Message::Write(String::from("This is a long message")),
        Message::ChangeColor(255, 0, 0),
    ];

    for msg in messages {
        process_message(msg);
    }
}
```

3. Compile and run the code by executing `cargo run` in the terminal.
