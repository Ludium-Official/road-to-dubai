- Learn currying applications through real-world examples
- Understand functional programming concepts related to currying

## Concept of Currying

Currying is a technique that transforms a function with multiple arguments into a chain of functions that each take a single argument. This is one of the core concepts in functional programming.

### Need for Currying

1. Increased function reusability: Ability to create new functions with partial arguments applied
2. Partial Application: Ability to create new functions by pre-applying some arguments
3. Function Composition: Easy composition of single-argument functions
4. Lazy Evaluation: Ability to delay function execution until all arguments are provided

## Implementing Currying

Here's how to implement currying in Rust:

```rust
fn curry_add(x: i32) -> impl Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    move |y| x + y
}
```

This function takes one argument and returns a new function. The returned function takes another argument and calculates the final result.

## Advantages and Disadvantages of Currying

### Advantages
1. Increased function reusability
2. Improved code modularity
3. Ease of function composition

## Currying Implementation in Rust

In Rust, currying can be implemented using closures and the `move` keyword:

```rust
fn curry_multiply(x: i32) -> impl Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    move |y| x * y
}

fn main() {
    let multiply_by_5 = curry_multiply(5);
    println!("5 * 3 = {}", multiply_by_5(3)); // Output: 5 * 3 = 15
}
```

## Real-world Use Cases

Example of applying currying to a logging function:
```rust
fn curry_log<F>(prefix: String) -> impl Fn(String) -> Box<dyn Fn(F) -> ()>
// nested impl not allowed
// Box<dyn Fn(F) -> ()> uses dynamic dispatch and can return various closure types
// impl Fn(F) -> () uses static dispatch and returns a single concrete type
where
    F: Fn(String) + 'static
{
    move |message| {
        let full_message = format!("{}: {}", prefix, message);
        Box::new(move |log_fn: F| log_fn(full_message.clone()))
    }
}

fn main() {
    let error_log = curry_log("ERROR".to_string());
    let print_error = error_log("Something went wrong".to_string());
    
    print_error(|msg| println!("{}", msg));
    // Output: ERROR: Something went wrong
}
```

## Practice in VSCode

1. Open VSCode and create a new Rust project: `cargo new rust_currying`
2. Write the following code in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
fn curry_add(x: i32) -> impl Fn(i32) -> i32 {
    move |y| x + y
}

fn main() {
    let add_5 = curry_add(5);
    println!("5 + 3 = {}", add_5(3));
    println!("5 + 7 = {}", add_5(7));
    
    let add_10 = curry_add(10);
    println!("10 + 3 = {}", add_10(3));
    println!("10 + 7 = {}", add_10(7));
}
```

3. Compile and run the code using the `cargo run` command in the terminal.

## Test Code

Here's the test code to verify that the example code works correctly:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_curry_add() {
        let add_5 = curry_add(5);
        assert_eq!(add_5(3), 8);
        assert_eq!(add_5(7), 12);

        let add_10 = curry_add(10);
        assert_eq!(add_10(3), 13);
        assert_eq!(add_10(7), 17);
    }
}
```

Add this test code to the end of your `src/main.rs` file and run tests using the `cargo test` command.
