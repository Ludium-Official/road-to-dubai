# Crates and Modules: Rust's Code Organization and Modularization Strategy

## Learning Objectives
- Understand Rust's crate and module system
- Recognize the importance of code organization and modularization
- Learn how to effectively use crates and modules in real projects
- Understand modularization strategy from a software engineering perspective

## Crates

A crate is Rust's compilation unit. One crate forms a tree of modules that produces a library or executable.

There are two types of crates:
1. Binary crates: Creates an executable
2. Library crates: Contains code intended for use by other programs

### Creating a Binary Crate

```bash
cargo new my_project
cd my_project
```

This creates a `src/main.rs` file, which becomes the crate's root.

### Creating a Library Crate

```bash
cargo new my_library --lib
cd my_library
```

This creates a `src/lib.rs` file, which becomes the library crate's root.

## Modules

Modules are used to group code and improve readability and reusability.

### Defining Modules

You can define modules in `src/lib.rs` or `src/main.rs`:

```rust
mod front_of_house {
    mod hosting {
        fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }
}
```

### Module Tree Structure

Modules form a tree structure, branching from the crate root into submodules.

```
crate
 └── front_of_house
     └── hosting
         └── add_to_waitlist
```

### Module and File Structure

Modules can be separated into different files. For example:

`src/lib.rs`:
```rust
mod front_of_house;

pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}
```

`src/front_of_house.rs`:
```rust
pub mod hosting;
```

`src/front_of_house/hosting.rs`:
```rust
pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
```

This makes code logically organized and easier to manage.

## Using External Crates

To use external crates, you need to add dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file.

1. Add dependency to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```

2. Use in code:

```rust
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..101);
    println!("Secret number: {}", secret_number);
}
```

This allows you to use the functionality from the `rand` crate in your project.

### Cargo.toml and Dependency Management
The `Cargo.toml` file defines project metadata and dependencies.

```toml
[package]
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
```

### Visibility and Encapsulation
Everything in Rust is private by default. Use the `pub` keyword to make items public.

```rust
mod back_of_house {
    pub struct Breakfast {
        pub toast: String,
        seasonal_fruit: String, // not public!
    }

    impl Breakfast {
        pub fn summer(toast: &str) -> Breakfast {
            Breakfast {
                toast: String::from(toast),
                seasonal_fruit: String::from("peaches"),
            }
        }
    }
}

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer("Rye");
    meal.toast = String::from("Wheat");
    // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from("blueberries"); // Compilation error!
}
```

## Modularization Strategy from Software Engineering Perspective

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle
Each module should have one clear responsibility. This increases cohesion and reduces coupling.
Remember: Each module should focus on one specific functionality or purpose.

```rust
// auth.rs
pub mod auth {
    pub fn login() { /* ... */ }
    pub fn logout() { /* ... */ }
}

// database.rs
pub mod database {
    pub fn connect() { /* ... */ }
    pub fn query() { /* ... */ }
}

// business_logic.rs
pub mod business_logic {
    pub fn process_data() { /* ... */ }
}
```

### 2. Dependency Inversion Principle
The abstraction layer strategy organizes the system into multiple layers, where each layer hides the details of lower layers and provides an abstracted interface to upper layers.
That is, divide the system into logical layers (e.g., UI, business logic, data access).
Each layer depends on lower layers but depends on abstracted interfaces (`trait`) rather than concrete implementations.

For example, let's say high-level module is business logic (user management system) and low-level module is database connection module. If business logic directly depends on database module, business logic must change when database changes.

Therefore, UserManagement should depend on DataStorage trait rather than Database.
Database also implements DataStorage trait.
Thus, both modules depend on abstraction (DataStorage).

```rust
// data_access.rs
pub trait DataAccess {
    fn fetch_data(&self) -> Vec<String>;
}

// business_logic.rs
pub struct BusinessLogic<T: DataAccess> {
    data_access: T,
}

impl<T: DataAccess> BusinessLogic<T> {
    pub fn process(&self) {
        let data = self.data_access.fetch_data();
        // Data processing logic
    }
}

// ui.rs
pub struct UI<T: BusinessLogic<dyn DataAccess>> {
    logic: T,
}

impl<T: BusinessLogic<dyn DataAccess>> UI<T> {
    pub fn display(&self) {
        // UI display logic
    }
}
```

### 3. Information Hiding
Information hiding is the principle of hiding internal implementation details of a module and exposing only well-defined interfaces externally.
That is, keep internal implementation details private.
Only expose necessary interfaces as public.

```rust
pub mod user_management {
    struct User {
        id: u64,
        name: String,
    }

    impl User {
        fn new(name: String) -> Self {
            // Internal implementation
        }
    }

    pub fn create_user(name: String) -> u64 {
        let user = User::new(name);
        // User creation logic
        user.id
    }
}
```

## Why is Rust's Default Visibility Private?

There are several reasons why all items in Rust are private by default:

1. **Enhanced Encapsulation**: Items not explicitly declared as public cannot be accessed from outside the module. This hides module internals and prevents unintended external use.

2. **Interface Stability**: Encourages careful design of public interfaces. Making everything public could make it difficult to change later.

3. **Prevent Mistakes**: Prevents accidentally exposing internal implementation details.

4. **Gradual Exposure**: Allows items to be gradually made public as needed. This aligns with the "principle of least privilege."
