# Smart Pointers

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concept and necessity of smart pointers.
- Learn the main smart pointer types provided by Rust.
- Grasp the characteristics, use cases, and internal working principles of each smart pointer.
- Understand the relationship between smart pointers and ownership, lifetime management.
- Learn how to implement custom smart pointers.
- Study the performance characteristics and optimization techniques of smart pointers.
- Acquire methods to effectively utilize smart pointers in actual code.

## Concept of Smart Pointers

Smart pointers are data structures that act like pointers but provide additional metadata and functionality. Unlike regular references, smart pointers usually own the data they point to. In Rust, smart pointers are typically created by implementing the `Deref` and `Drop` traits.

### Necessity of Smart Pointers

1. Multiple Ownership: Allow data to be shared by multiple owners.
2. Interior Mutability: Enable access to mutable data through immutable references.
3. Runtime Polymorphism: Enable dynamic dispatch through trait objects.

## Main Smart Pointers in Rust

### 1. Box<T>

`Box<T>` is the simplest form of smart pointer. It allocates data on the heap and stores a pointer to that heap data on the stack.
Note that in currying, we can't nest `impl Fn`, so we've used something like `impl Fn(String) -> Box<dyn Fn(F) -> ()>`.
It's freely applicable to all types.

Characteristics:
- Useful when dealing with types whose size is unknown at compile time.
- Used to transfer ownership of large data without copying.
- Also used to create trait objects. `Box<dyn Trait>`

### 2. Rc<T>

`Rc<T>` stands for Reference Counting and provides multiple ownership. It allows multiple immutable references to the same data.

Characteristics:
- Used when data needs to be shared in multiple parts of the program.
- Frees memory when the last owner is dropped, using reference counting.
- Can create circular references, potentially leading to memory leaks.

### 3. RefCell<T>

`RefCell<T>` is a smart pointer that provides interior mutability. It allows mutable access to data through immutable references.

Characteristics:
- Checks borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile time.
- Safe only in single-threaded environments.
- Accesses inner value through `borrow()` and `borrow_mut()` methods.

## Practice in VSCode

1. Open VSCode and create a new Rust project: `cargo new smart_pointers`
2. Write the following code in the `src/main.rs` file:

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    children: RefCell<Vec<Rc<Node>>>,
}

impl Node {
    fn new(value: i32) -> Rc<Node> {
        Rc::new(Node {
            value,
            children: RefCell::new(vec![]),
        })
    }

    fn add_child(&self, child: Rc<Node>) {
        self.children.borrow_mut().push(child);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let root = Node::new(1);
    let child1 = Node::new(2);
    let child2 = Node::new(3);

    root.add_child(Rc::clone(&child1));
    root.add_child(Rc::clone(&child2));

    child1.add_child(Rc::clone(&child2));

    println!("Root: {:?}", root);
}
```

3. Compile and run the code by executing the `cargo run` command in the terminal.

## Test Code

Add the following test code at the end of the `src/main.rs` file:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_node_creation() {
        let node = Node::new(5);
        assert_eq!(node.value, 5);
        assert!(node.children.borrow().is_empty());
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_add_child() {
        let parent = Node::new(1);
        let child = Node::new(2);
        parent.add_child(Rc::clone(&child));
        assert_eq!(parent.children.borrow().len(), 1);
        assert_eq!(parent.children.borrow()[0].value, 2);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_multiple_ownership() {
        let node1 = Node::new(1);
        let node2 = Node::new(2);
        let node3 = Node::new(3);

        node1.add_child(Rc::clone(&node2));
        node1.add_child(Rc::clone(&node3));
        node2.add_child(Rc::clone(&node3));

        assert_eq!(Rc::strong_count(&node3), 3);
    }
}
```
