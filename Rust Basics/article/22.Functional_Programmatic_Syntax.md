# Functional Programming Syntax in Rust

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the main concepts of functional programming in Rust
- Implement concepts like pure functions, immutability, higher-order functions, recursion, and pattern matching in Rust code
- Understand how functional programming paradigms are applied in Rust

## 1. Pure Functions

Pure functions are the core of functional programming. They always return the same output for the same input and have no side effects.
The way to identify them is that they should have no implicit inputs or outputs.
For example, implicit inputs refer to global variables, etc.,
and outputs refer to side effects like changing global variables or printing to console.

### Characteristics:
- Depend only on inputs
- Don't modify external state
- Provide predictable results

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

fn main() {
    let result = add(5, 3);
    println!("Result: {}", result);  // Always prints 8
}
```

This `add` function is pure. It always returns the same result for the same input and doesn't modify external state.

## 2. Immutability

In functional programming, data once created is not modified. Instead, new data is created and returned.

### Benefits:
- Improved predictability
- Easier concurrent processing
- Reduced side effects

```rust
fn main() {
    let original = vec![1, 2, 3];
    let doubled = double_vector(&original);
    
    println!("Original: {:?}", original);
    println!("Doubled: {:?}", doubled);
}

fn double_vector(v: &Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    v.iter().map(|&x| x * 2).collect()
}
```

In this example, `double_vector` creates and returns a new vector instead of modifying the original.

## 3. Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order functions can take other functions as arguments or return functions. This allows for higher levels of abstraction and increased code reusability.

### Characteristics:
- Treat functions as values
- Improve code modularity
- Enable flexible abstraction

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let squared: Vec<i32> = numbers.iter().map(|&x| x * x).collect();
    println!("Squared: {:?}", squared);

    let sum: i32 = numbers.iter().fold(0, |acc, &x| acc + x);
    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
}
```

Here, `map` and `fold` are higher-order functions that take closures as arguments to perform operations.

## 4. Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself. In functional programming, recursion is often used instead of loops.

```rust
fn factorial(n: u64) -> u64 {
    if n == 0 {
        1
    } else {
        n * factorial(n - 1)
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("Factorial of 5: {}", factorial(5));
}
```

In this example, the `factorial` function calls itself to perform calculations.

## 5. Pattern Matching

Pattern matching is a powerful feature that analyzes data structure and executes code accordingly.

### Characteristics:
- Easily handle complex data structures
- Improve code readability
- Enable compile-time error detection

```rust
enum Shape {
    Circle(f64),
    Rectangle(f64, f64),
    Triangle(f64, f64, f64),
}

fn area(shape: Shape) -> f64 {
    match shape {
        Shape::Circle(r) => std::f64::consts::PI * r * r,
        Shape::Rectangle(w, h) => w * h,
        Shape::Triangle(a, b, c) => {
            let s = (a + b + c) / 2.0;
            (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)).sqrt()
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let circle = Shape::Circle(5.0);
    let rectangle = Shape::Rectangle(4.0, 3.0);
    
    println!("Circle area: {}", area(circle));
    println!("Rectangle area: {}", area(rectangle));
}
```

In this example, the `area` function uses pattern matching to calculate areas of different shapes.

## 6. Closures

Closures are anonymous functions that can capture their environment. They are an important part of functional programming in Rust.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 4;
    let equal_to_x = |z| z == x;
    
    let y = 4;
    assert!(equal_to_x(y));
}
```

Here, `equal_to_x` is a closure that captures the value of `x` from its environment.

## 7. Iterators

Iterators provide a way to process sequences of items. Rust's iterators use lazy evaluation for efficient processing.

lazy evaluation will be explained further later on. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let sum: i32 = v.iter()
                    .filter(|&x| x % 2 == 0)
                    .map(|&x| x * x)
                    .sum();
    println!("Sum of squares of even numbers: {}", sum);
}
```

This example uses iterator method chaining to calculate the sum of squares of even numbers in a vector.
