# Variables and constants

## Learning objectives
- Understand the concepts of variables and constants in Rust.
- Identify the difference between immutability and variability.
- Learn the concept and usage of shadowing.

## Declaration of Variables

In Rust, variables can be defined through `let`. Note that unlike other programming languages, Rust's basic variable is **immutable**. Because it is immutable, once a variable is declared, its value cannot be changed.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6; // Error occurs on this line
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

If you run the code above, you can see that an error occurs because you were trying to change x to 6, which should be immutable.

```
error[E0384]: re-assignment of immutable variable `x`
 --> src/main.rs:4:5
  |
2 |     let x = 5;
  |         - first assignment to `x`
3 |     println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ re-assignment of immutable variable
```

## The need for immutability

The reason Rust left the basic variable unchanged is to force Rust to write the code so that it can take advantage of the safety and easy simultaneity it provides.

In Rust, the compiler guarantees unaltered values, which in fact does not change. What this means is that it makes the code more reasonable because you don't have to track how the values of variables change when writing or analyzing the code.

## Mutable variable

Nevertheless, because mutability can be very useful, Rust provides mutability by adding the `mut` keyword to the variable.

Rust can declare a variable by adding `mut` as a prefix for the variable name.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;  
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

As above, if the program is executed through `mut`, it can be confirmed that the code is executed well.

## Constant

It is said that Rust's basic variable is immutable, so what difference does this make from constant?

In Rust, constant can be generated through the `const` keyword.

- Unlike the basic variable, `const` can be said to be immutability itself, not immutability in the basic setting.
- `const` is characterized by the fact that the data type to be learned later must be declared.
- `const` can be declared in any area, including the entire area.
- Only the const expression `const` may be set, the result value of the function call or other values determined at the execution time may not be set.

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
```

## Shadowing

Through shadowing, Rust can declare a variable with the same name as the previously declared variable, and the new variable shows the previous variable. Let's look at the example code.

```rust
fn main() {
let x = 5;
let x = x + 1;
let x = x * 2;
println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

This program binds a value of 5 to x at the beginning, and it can be seen that the value of x becomes 6 by showing x with the repeated phrase `let x =` and adding 1 to the original value. The following results are obtained by executing `x = x*2` on the same principle.

```
$ cargo run
Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31 secs
Running `target/debug/variables`
The value of x is: 12
```

Unlike `mut`, showing will get an error when compiling if you try to substitute a new value into a variable without using the `let` keyword. Also, the value can be changed, but the variable remains unchanged after that.

Let's understand showing with more examples.

```rust
let spaces = " ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```

As above, it can be seen that the variable spaces of the string type are declared and shown in the next spaces.

Let's find out what we need to be careful about when showing.

```rust
let mut spaces = " ";
spaces = spaces.len();
```

If showing is performed as above, it can be confirmed that an error occurs during compilation. It can be confirmed that an error occurs when attempting to show the spaces variable declared as `mut` to a basic variable with invariance.

## Example Code

The following is a simple example with variables, constants, and showing.

```rust
fn main() {
// Immutable variable
let x = 5;
println!("The value of x is: {}", x);

// Mutable variable
let mut y = 10;
println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
y = 15;
println!("The updated value of y is: {}", y);

// Constant
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 100_000;
println!("The maximum points is: {}", MAX_POINTS);

// Shadowing
let z = " ";
let z = z.len();
println!("The length of z is: {}", z);
}
```

## Practice in VSCode

1. Open VSCode and create a new Rust project: `cargo new variables`
2. Paste the above example code into the file `src/main.rs`.
3. Compile and execute the code by executing the `cargo run` command at the terminal.
4. Check the results, and make sure you understand the concepts of immutability, mutability, constant, and showing of the variables.

## Test Code

The test code to verify that the example code is working correctly is as follows:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
use super::*;

#[test]
fn test_immutable_variable() {
let x = 5;
assert_eq!(x, 5);
}

#[test]
fn test_mutable_variable() {
let mut y = 10;
y = 15;
assert_eq!(y, 15);
}

#[test]
fn test_constant() {
assert_eq!(MAX_POINTS, 100_000);
}

#[test]
fn test_shadowing() {
let z = " ";
let z = z.len();
assert_eq!(z, 3);
}
}
```

You can add this test code to the end of the file `src/main.rs`  and run the command `cargo test` to perform the test. If all tests pass, it can be confirmed that the example code has been written correctly.
