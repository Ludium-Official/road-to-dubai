# Struct

## 1. Basic Concept of Struct 

Struct is a fundamental way to create custom data types in Rust. It allows you to group multiple related values into a meaningful unit.

### 1.1 Defining a Struct

```rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}
```

This code defines a struct named `User`. Each field has a name and type. While the order of fields in a Rust struct is not important, you might want to consider field order for memory layout optimization.

### 1.2 Creating Struct Instances

```rust
fn main() {
    let user1 = User {
        email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
        username: String::from("someusername123"),
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    };
}
```

You must specify values for all fields of a struct, though the order can differ from the definition. This is one way Rust ensures type safety.

### 1.3 Field Init Shorthand

When function parameters have the same names as struct fields, you can use field init shorthand:

```rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email,
        username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

This shorthand improves code readability and reduces repetition.

### 1.4 Struct Update Syntax

When you want to reuse most values from an existing instance while changing a few:

```rust
let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    ..user1
};
```

`..user1` takes the remaining unspecified fields from `user1`. Note that this may involve ownership transfer.
Looking closer, types that implement the Copy trait perform shallow copies (byte-wise copy), while others perform move operations.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
    address: String,
}

fn main() {
    let person1 = Person {
        name: String::from("Alice"),
        age: 30,
        address: String::from("123 Main St"),
    };

    // Creating person2 using some fields from person1
    let person2 = Person {
        age: 31,
        ..person1
    };

    // This causes ownership issues
    println!("person1: {:?}", person1);
    println!("person2: {:?}", person2);
}
```
This code will result in a compilation error. Let's examine why:

String type ownership transfer:

- The name and address fields of person1 are String types
- String doesn't implement the Copy trait, so ownership is transferred instead of copying
- Using ..person1 syntax transfers ownership of name and address fields from person1 to person2

Partial ownership transfer:

- The age field is u32 type, which implements the Copy trait, so it's copied
- Therefore, person1.age remains usable

Compilation error:

- Error occurs at the line println!("person1: {:?}", person1);
- This is because ownership of person1's name and address fields has already been transferred to person2

## 2. Advanced Struct Features

### 2.1 Defining Methods

Adding methods to structs is a good way to group related functionality and encapsulation.

```rust
impl User {
    fn is_active(&self) -> bool {
        self.active
    }

    fn deactivate(&mut self) {
        self.active = false;
    }

    fn post_count(&self) -> u64 {
        // Assuming: returns the user's post count
        42
    }
}
```

Here, `&self` means the method borrows the struct instance as an immutable reference. `&mut self` indicates a mutable reference.

### 2.2 Associated Functions

You can define functions within `impl` blocks that don't take `self` as a parameter. These are called associated functions and are often used as constructors.

```rust
impl User {
    fn new(username: String, email: String) -> User {
        User {
            username,
            email,
            active: true,
            sign_in_count: 1,
        }
    }
}

// Usage example
let user2 = User::new(String::from("user2"), String::from("user2@example.com"));
```

Associated functions are called using the `::` syntax.

### 2.3 Derive Macros

Rust allows automatic trait implementation for structs through the `derive` attribute.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}
```

This code automatically implements `Debug`, `Clone`, and `PartialEq` traits for the `Point` struct. This reduces boilerplate code and increases productivity.

- `Debug`: Enables debug output like `println!("{:?}", point);`
- `Clone`: Enables explicit creation of identical objects similar to deep copy mechanism via `point.clone()`
- `PartialEq`: Allows comparing two `Point` instances using the `==` operator

## 3. Structs and Memory

### 3.1 Memory Layout

A struct's memory layout is determined by the order and types of its fields. Rust adds padding between fields to optimize memory alignment.

```rust
struct Foo {
    a: u8,
    b: u32,
    c: u8,
}
```

This struct might actually be 12 bytes in size (1 + 3(padding) + 4 + 1 + 3(padding)) due to 4-byte alignment for memory access efficiency.

You can optimize memory layout by reordering fields:

```rust
struct OptimizedFoo {
    b: u32,
    a: u8,
    c: u8,
}
```

Now `OptimizedFoo` is 6 bytes (4 + 1 + 1).

### 3.2 Compile-Time Layout Determination

Rust's struct layout is determined at compile time, providing several important benefits:

1. No runtime overhead: Field access is a simple offset calculation
2. Predictable memory usage: Program memory usage can be accurately predicted
3. Cache-friendly: Knowledge of data structure layout enables cache optimization

For example:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

fn main() {
    let point = Point { x: 1.0, y: 2.0 };
    println!("Size of Point: {}", std::mem::size_of::<Point>());
}
```

This code determines the size of `Point` struct at compile time and uses this information without additional runtime cost.

## 4. Useful Struct Patterns

### 4.1 Type State Pattern

The type state pattern is a powerful technique that prevents runtime errors by checking states at compile time.

```rust
struct Open;
struct Closed;

struct Door<State> {
    state: std::marker::PhantomData<State>,
}

impl Door<Closed> {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Door { state: std::marker::PhantomData }
    }

    fn open(self) -> Door<Open> {
        println!("Opening the door");
        Door { state: std::marker::PhantomData }
    }
}

impl Door<Open> {
    fn close(self) -> Door<Closed> {
        println!("Closing the door");
        Door { state: std::marker::PhantomData }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let door = Door::new();
    let open_door = door.open();
    // let still_open = open_door.open(); // Compile error: can't open an already open door
    let closed_door = open_door.close();
}
```

This pattern prevents incorrect operations like opening an already open door at compile time. `PhantomData` tells the compiler that the `State` type parameter is being used.
To explain the syntax, `Door<State>` uses generics, and `impl Door<Closed>` and `impl Door<Open>` implement methods for specific types.

### 4.2 Builder Pattern

The builder pattern simplifies and clarifies the creation of complex objects. It's particularly useful when there are many optional parameters.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}

struct UserBuilder {
    username: Option<String>,
    email: Option<String>,
    sign_in_count: Option<u64>,
    active: Option<bool>,
}

impl UserBuilder {
    fn new() -> UserBuilder {
        UserBuilder {
            username: None,
            email: None,
            sign_in_count: None,
            active: None,
        }
    }

    fn username(mut self, username: String) -> UserBuilder {
        self.username = Some(username);
        self
    }

    fn email(mut self, email: String) -> UserBuilder {
        self.email = Some(email);
        self
    }

    fn sign_in_count(mut self, count: u64) -> UserBuilder {
        self.sign_in_count = Some(count);
        self
    }

    fn active(mut self, active: bool) -> UserBuilder {
        self.active = Some(active);
        self
    }

    fn build(self) -> Result<User, &'static str> {
        let username = self.username.ok_or("Username is required")?;
        let email = self.email.ok_or("Email is required")?;

        // Pattern for catching missing fields at runtime

        Ok(User {
            username,
            email,
            sign_in_count: self.sign_in_count.unwrap_or(0),
            active: self.active.unwrap_or(false),
        })
    }
}

fn main() {
    let user = UserBuilder::new()
        .username("johndoe".to_string())
        .email("john@example.com".to_string())
        .active(true)
        .build();
        // Helps handle complex objects

    match user {
        Ok(u) => println!("User created: {:?}", u),
        Err(e) => println!("Error creating user: {}", e),
    }
}
```

This pattern allows step-by-step object creation and can generate runtime errors for missing required fields.

### 4.3 Newtype Pattern

The newtype pattern wraps existing types to create new types. This enhances type safety and semantic clarity.

```rust
struct Meters(f64);
struct Kilometers(f64);

impl Meters {
    fn to_kilometers(&self) -> Kilometers {
        Kilometers(self.0 / 1000.0)
    }
}

impl Kilometers {
    fn to_meters(&self) -> Meters {
        Meters(self.0 * 1000.0)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let distance = Meters(5000.0);
    let km_distance = distance.to_kilometers();
    println!("{} meters is {} kilometers", distance.0, km_distance.0);
}
```

This pattern prevents unit conversion errors and clarifies code intent.

## 5. Practice in VSCode

1. Open VSCode and create a new Rust project: `cargo new rust_struct`
2. Write the following code in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn new(width: u32, height: u32) -> Self {
        Rectangle { width, height }
    }

    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }

    fn square(size: u32) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle { width: size, height: size }
    }
}

struct RectangleBuilder {
    width: Option<u32>,
    height: Option<u32>,
}

impl RectangleBuilder {
    fn new() -> Self {
        RectangleBuilder {
            width: None,
            height: None,
        }
    }

    fn width(mut self, width: u32) -> Self {
        self.width = Some(width);
        self
    }

    fn height(mut self, height: u32) -> Self {
        self.height = Some(height);
        self
    }

    fn build(self) -> Result<Rectangle, &'static str> {
        let width = self.width.ok_or("Width is required")?;
        let height = self.height.ok_or("Height is required")?;
        Ok(Rectangle { width, height })
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle::new(30, 50);
    let rect2 = Rectangle::new(10, 40);
    let rect3 = Rectangle::new(60, 45);
    let square = Rectangle::square(20);

    println!("rect1 is {:?}", rect1);
    println!("The area of rect1 is {} square pixels.", rect1.area());
    println!("Can rect1 hold rect2? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
    println!("Can rect1 hold rect3? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect3));
    println!("Square: {:?}", square);

    let rect4 = RectangleBuilder::new()
        .width(35)
        .height(55)
        .build();

    match rect4 {
        Ok(r) => println!("Built rectangle: {:?}", r),
        Err(e) => println!("Error building rectangle: {}", e),
    }

    let rect5 = RectangleBuilder::new()
        .width(40)
        .build();

    match rect5 {
        Ok(r) => println!("Built rectangle: {:?}", r),
        Err(e) => println!("Error building rectangle: {}", e),
    }
}
```

3. Run `cargo run` in the terminal to compile and execute the code.

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn larger_can_hold_smaller() {
        let larger = Rectangle::new(8, 7);
        let smaller = Rectangle::new(5, 1);
        assert!(larger.can_hold(&smaller));
    }

    #[test]
    fn smaller_cannot_hold_larger() {
        let larger = Rectangle::new(8, 7);
        let smaller = Rectangle::new(5, 1);
        assert!(!smaller.can_hold(&larger));
    }

    #[test]
    fn area_calculation() {
        let rect = Rectangle::new(5, 5);
        assert_eq!(rect.area(), 25);
    }

    #[test]
    fn square_creation() {
        let square = Rectangle::square(5);
        assert_eq!(square.width, 5);
        assert_eq!(square.height, 5);
    }

    #[test]
    fn builder_success() {
        let rect = RectangleBuilder::new()
            .width(10)
            .height(20)
            .build();
        assert!(rect.is_ok());
        let rect = rect.unwrap();
        assert_eq!(rect.width, 10);
        assert_eq!(rect.height, 20);
    }

    #[test]
    fn builder_failure() {
        let rect = RectangleBuilder::new()
            .width(10)
            .build();
        assert!(rect.is_err());
    }
}
```

You can add this test code at the end of your `src/main.rs` file and run tests using the `cargo test` command.
