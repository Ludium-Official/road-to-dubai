# Rust's Unique Features

Rust has features that set it apart from other programming languages. These features were deliberately reflected from the time Rust was designed. Understanding these points will help you learn Rust.

## Zero-Cost Abstraction

One of the core principles of Rust is "Zero-Cost Abstraction." The concept originally came from functional programming, but the term itself came from C++. The founder of C++ stated:

"Generally, C++ implementations follow the zero-overhead principle: you don't pay for what you don't use. Furthermore, you can't implement it in a better way than you can directly code for what you use."

If you solve this and explain it, here's the thing:

1. Unused features do not affect program performance.
2. The performance of the abstracted code is equivalent to the manually optimized code.

Let me give you an example. Rust's 'lifetime' concept illustrates this principle well. Lifetime checks the validity of a pointer or reference at the time of compilation. This eliminates the need for additional checks during execution.

On the other hand, let's look at JavaScript. When you assign an object to a variable in JavaScript, it actually stores a reference that points to that object. Copying a variable does not create a new object, but rather an additional reference that points to the same object. So how do you ensure that these references always point to a valid object? JavaScript continues to track the reference count during execution for this purpose. This is an expense that is always incurred whether the programmer wants it or not.

Rust approaches it differently. When compiling, we calculate in advance when each value can be safely deleted, and we don't do this check during execution. The concept of lifespan determines when.

As another example, consider Java's method override. When Java calls an override method, you have to find the actual implementation and run it. This is called a 'dynamic dispatch', and this process causes some performance degradation. Even if JVM optimizes, this cost cannot be completely eliminated.

Rust basically uses 'static dispatch'. Except for the trace object, all function calls are determined at the time of compilation to use which implementation. This method can create a more rigid design than Java, but it has advantages in terms of execution speed.

## Explicit expression preference

Rust prefers clarity to ambiguity. Considering the integrer promotion of C, C implicitly converts it into `int` or `unsigned int` when performing integer calculations.

Rust hates this implicit transformation. It tries to avoid the problems or hidden costs that implicit transformation such as `1 + a` in JavaScript can bring.

For example, from Rust 2018, when using a trace object for dynamic dispatch, the keyword `dyn` must be explicitly attached. Type conversion should also use the `as` keyword or `try_from` method directly. In particular, `try_from` is a recommended method when there may be information loss.

This approach can make the code a little bit more redundant, but it allows for a clearer understanding of its behavior.
