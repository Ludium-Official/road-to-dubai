# Fuction

## Learning objectives
- Understand the principle of internal operation of the Rust function.
- Identify the relationship between the function and the ownership.
- We learn the differences and use cases between static and dynamic dispatches.
- Learn the concept and usage of function pointers and closers.

## Internal behavior of a function

Rust functions are statically dispatched at the time of compilation, which minimizes the overhead of function calls. The following process occurs when calling a function:

1. Create Stack Frame: New Stack Frame is created when calling a function.
2. Copy Parameters: Functional parameters are copied to the stack.
3. Move control flow: the program counter moves to the start address of the function.
4. Run function: the body of the function is executed.
5. Processing return values: If there is a return value, it is stored in a specified register or stack.
6. Stack Frame Clearance: Stack frames are removed at the end of the function.

Example:
```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
a + b
}

fn main() {
let result = add(5, 3);
println!("Result: {}", result);
}
```

The `add` function call in this code is handled as follows:

1. Create a new stack frame for the function `add`
2. Copy `a` and `b` parameter values (5 and 3) to the stack
3. Run the body of the `add` function
4. Save result value (8) in return register
5. Remove stack frame of function `add`
6. Save return value from function `main` in variable `result`

## Functions and Ownership

Rust's ownership system also applies to function calls. Ownership can be moved or loaned when transferring values to functions.

### Ownership Transfer
```rust
fn take_ownership(s: String) {
println!("{}", s);
} // where s is dropped

fn main() {
let s = String::from("hello");
take_ownership(s);
// println!("{}", s); // Compilation error: ownership moved for s
}
```

In this example, the ownership of `s` moves to the function `take_ownership`. After calling the function, `s` is no longer available in `main`.

### Borrow Reference
```rust
fn borrow(s: &String) {
println!("{}", s);
}

fn main() {
let s = String::from("hello");
borrow(&s);
println!("{}", s); // Normal operation: s is still valid
}
```

Here, only the reference of `s` is transmitted to the `borrow` function, so `s` can be continuously used in `main`.

### Static Dispatch
Functions that are being called are decided at Compile time. This is the core of zero-cost abstraction 

```rust
fn static_dispatch<T: Display>(t: T) {
    println!("{}", t);
}

fn main() {
    static_dispatch("hello");
    static_dispatch(5);
}
```

In this code, the static_dispatch function is specialized for each type (&str and i32) at compile time.

### Dynamic Dispatch
Functions that are being called are decided at Runtime. Which is implemented by trait

```rust
trait Animal {
    fn make_sound(&self);
}

struct Dog;
impl Animal for Dog {
    fn make_sound(&self) {
        println!("Woof!");
    }
}

struct Cat;
impl Animal for Cat {
    fn make_sound(&self) {
        println!("Meow!");
    }
}

fn animal_sound(animal: &dyn Animal) {
    animal.make_sound();
}

fn main() {
    let dog = Dog;
    let cat = Cat;
    animal_sound(&dog);
    animal_sound(&cat);
}
```

Here, the animal_sound function calls the make_sound method of the actual object at runtime.

## Function Pointers, Closures

### Function Pointer
 with function pointers, functions can be passed as values 

```rust
fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

fn do_twice(f: fn(i32) -> i32, arg: i32) -> i32 {
    f(f(arg))
}

fn main() {
    let result = do_twice(add_one, 5);
    println!("Result: {}", result); // 출력: Result: 7
}
```

### Closure
Closures are anonymous functions that can capture their environment.


```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 4;
    let equal_to_x = |z| z == x;
    let y = 4;
    assert!(equal_to_x(y));
}
```

Closures are implemented internally as one of three traits: Fn, FnMut, and FnOnce. The compiler selects the appropriate trait based on how the closure captures its environment.


## Practice in VSCode

1. Open VSCode and create a new Rust project: cargo new rust_functions
2. Write the following code in src/main.rs:  

```rust
fn main() {
    //  Static Dispatch
    println!("Static dispatch:");
    static_dispatch("hello");
    static_dispatch(5);

    //  Dynamic Dispatch
    println!("\nDynamic dispatch:");
    let dog = Dog;
    let cat = Cat;
    animal_sound(&dog);
    animal_sound(&cat);

    // Function Pointers
    println!("\nFunction pointer:");
    let result = do_twice(add_one, 5);
    println!("Result: {}", result);

    // Closures
    println!("\nClosure:");
    let x = 4;
    let equal_to_x = |z| z == x;
    let y = 4;
    println!("Is y equal to x? {}", equal_to_x(y));
}

fn static_dispatch<T: std::fmt::Display>(t: T) {
    println!("{}", t);
}

trait Animal {
    fn make_sound(&self);
}

struct Dog;
impl Animal for Dog {
    fn make_sound(&self) {
        println!("Woof!");
    }
}

struct Cat;
impl Animal for Cat {
    fn make_sound(&self) {
        println!("Meow!");
    }
}

fn animal_sound(animal: &dyn Animal) {
    animal.make_sound();
}

fn add_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}

fn do_twice(f: fn(i32) -> i32, arg: i32) -> i32 {
    f(f(arg))
}
```

3. On terminal try `cargo run` to compile and execute the code 

## Test Code

Test Code to assure the example code is working right is as following: 
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_static_dispatch() {
        static_dispatch("test");
        static_dispatch(10);
        // 컴파일되면 성공
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_dynamic_dispatch() {
        let dog = Dog;
        let cat = Cat;
        animal_sound(&dog);
        animal_sound(&cat);
        // 컴파일되면 성공
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_function_pointer() {
        assert_eq!(do_twice(add_one, 5), 7);
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_closure() {
        let x = 4;
        let equal_to_x = |z| z == x;
        assert!(equal_to_x(4));
        assert!(!equal_to_x(5));
    }
}
```
