# Comments in Rust

## Learning Objectives
- Understand and appropriately use different types of comments in Rust
- Learn how to write and utilize documentation comments
- Master effective comment writing techniques and best practices

## Types of Comments and Usage

In Rust, comments are used to add explanations to code or temporarily disable code. Comments are ignored by the compiler and therefore doesn't affect program execution. However, they play a crucial role in understanding and maintaining code. Rust provides three main types of comments.

Good use of comments can make code more understandable and maintainable. However, the best practice is to write clean code that's understandable without comments (through function names, parameter names, etc. - these are called signifiers, for more details refer to the book "The Programmer's Brain").
Comments should be considered the next step after clean and understandable code.

### Single-line Comments

Single-line comments start with two slashes `//`. Everything after these symbols until the end of the line is treated as a comment.

```rust
fn main() {
    // This is a single-line comment
    let x = 5; // Assign 5 to variable x

    // This entire line is commented out and won't be executed as code
    // println!("This line won't execute");

    // Using single-line comments to explain code
    let y = 10; // y is an integer variable
    let z = x + y; // z is the sum of x and y

    println!("x + y = {}", z); // Print the result
}
```

Single-line comments are useful for brief explanations or short notes next to code lines.

### Multi-line Comments

For longer comments spanning multiple lines, use `/*` to start and `*/` to end. Everything between these symbols is treated as a comment.

```rust
fn main() {
    /* This is
       a multi-line
       comment */

    let complex_calculation = /* You can put
                                multi-line comments
                                in the middle of code */
        5 + 5 * 2 - 10;

    /*
     * Multi-line comments can be aligned
     * with asterisks like this for
     * better readability.
     */

    println!("Complex calculation result: {}", complex_calculation);
}
```

Multi-line comments are useful for algorithm explanations, detailed function behavior descriptions, or temporarily disabling blocks of code.

### Documentation Comments

Rust has a special type of comment called 'documentation comments' used for generating code documentation. There are single-line doc comments starting with `///` and multi-line doc comments starting with `/**` and ending with `*/`.

```rust
/// This function adds two numbers
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `a` - First integer
/// * `b` - Second integer
///
/// # Return Value
///
/// Returns the sum of the two integers
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// let result = add(2, 3);
/// assert_eq!(result, 5);
/// ```
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}

/** This is a multi-line documentation comment
 * Used for detailed explanations of
 * structs, enums, etc.
 *
 * # Fields
 *
 * * `x` - x coordinate
 * * `y` - y coordinate
 */
struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 3.0, y: 4.0 };
    println!("Point coordinates: ({}, {})", p.x, p.y);

    let sum = add(5, 7);
    println!("5 + 7 = {}", sum);
}
```

Documentation comments are used with the `cargo doc` command to generate HTML documentation. This documentation greatly helps other developers understand the code.

## Comment Usage Tips

1. Focus on explaining 'why' rather than 'what' the code does
2. Use comments when code is complex or unclear
3. Keep comments up to date with code changes
4. Too many comments can make code harder to read - balance is important
5. Use documentation comments to automatically generate API documentation
6. Include example code in comments to help users understand usage

## Practice in VSCode

1. Open VSCode and create a new Rust project: `cargo new rust_comments`
2. Write the following code in `src/main.rs`:

```rust
/// Function to add two integers
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `a` - First integer
/// * `b` - Second integer
///
/// # Return Value
///
/// Returns the sum of the two integers
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    // Simply add and return the two numbers
    a + b
}

fn main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    let x = 5;
    let y = 7;

    /* Multi-line comment example
       Call add function to calculate result */
    let result = add(x, y);

    // Print result
    println!("{} + {} = {}", x, y, result);
}
```

3. Compile and run the code using `cargo run` in the terminal
4. Run `cargo doc --open` to view the generated documentation

## Test Code

Here's test code to verify that the comment examples work correctly:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_add() {
        assert_eq!(add(2, 3), 5);
        assert_eq!(add(-1, 1), 0);
        assert_eq!(add(0, 0), 0);
    }
}
```

Add this test code to the end of `src/main.rs` and run `cargo test` to perform the tests.
