# Gov module

## 0. `gov` module
The `gov` module allows you to enable governance features in the Cosmos SDK. The following is a list of features that the module currently supports
- Proposal submission: Users can submit proposals by depositing a certain amount of tokens. Once the specified minimum deposit is reached, the proposal is opened for voting.
- Voting: Participants can vote on proposals that reach the minimum deposit.
- Inheritance and penalties: Delegators inherit the validator's votes if they don't vote themselves.
- Deposit claims: Users who deposit into a proposal can recover their deposit if the proposal is accepted or rejected. If the proposal is rejected or does not enter the voting period, the deposit is burned.

## 1. Status
1. [Proposal](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/gov.proto#L51-L120): Stores basic information about the proposal (title, content, proponent, proposal start and end times), as well as information to count votes. 
2. [Params](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/gov.proto#L152-L220): Defines the rules by which voting is executed. Only one set of Params can exist at a time. To make changes to a Param set, such as modifying values in governance or adding/removing Param fields, you must create a new Param set and make the old one inactive.
3. [Deposit](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/proto/cosmos/gov/v1/gov.proto#L38-L49): Stores information about the deposit proposed in the proposal and the proposer. 
4. [ValidatorGovInfo](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/x/gov/types/v1/tally.go#L8-L15): This type is used by the temporary map used when tallying.
6. [ProposalQueue](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/x/gov/types/v1/proposal.go#L86-L89): A queue `queue[proposalID]` containing all the `ProposalIDs` of proposals that have reached the minimum deposit. During [`EndBlock`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/x/gov/abci.go), all proposals whose voting period has ended are removed. To process a completed proposal, the application counts the votes, calculates the number of votes for each validator, and verifies that all validators in the validator set have voted. If the proposal is accepted, the deposit is refunded. 

## 2. status lookup

## 3. State Conversion
Let's take a quick look at a list of the state transitions that occur in the `gov` module:
1. deposit: [tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/gov#deposit-4)
2. draft-proposal: [tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/gov#draft-proposal)
3. submit-proposal: [tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/gov#submit-proposal)
4. submit-legacy-proposal: [tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/gov#submit-legacy-proposal)
5. cancel-proposal: [tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/gov#cancel-proposal)
6. weighted-vote: [tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/gov#weighted-vote)

## 4. Practice 
In the Cosmos SDK `v0.46.0` release, the `gov` module was upgraded from `v1beta1` to `v1`. This practice requires you to use the binary in the chain that contains the v1 gov module, so we will use the `v0.47.0` that you learned about in step2.

This practice focuses on how to participate in governance by creating and voting on proposals.

### 1. Run simd 
> If you have used `simd` before, you may already have a `.simapp` directory in your home directory. If you want to keep the old data, you must save the directory to a different location or use the `--home` flag to specify a different directory for each command. If you do not want to keep the old data, remove the old directory (`rm -rf ~/.simapp`).

Clone the cosmos-sdk repository and change the version to `v0.47.0`:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
$ cd cosmos-sdk && git checkout v0.47.0
```

`simd` Build the binary:
```sh
$ make install
```

Once the build is complete, verify with a version check that `simd` is working properly: 
```sh
$ simd version

0.47.0 # good!
```

#### Set up the chain 
Set up a chain ID:
```sh
$ simd config chain-id gov-demo
```

Set up a keyring backend:
```sh
$ simd config keyring-backend test
```

#### Setting up a key 
We need to add a key for the chain user:
```sh
$ simd keys add alice && simd keys add bob
```

For an overview of keys, use the following:
```sh
$ simd keys list
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
- address: cosmos1qprjna2rll8jnqht5wcqa76fufuha4vlag4r8n
  name: alice
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AvGQb0QwVny4hOTOXRGXCgcWN7t//TyQqxbzEZt5Uqgi"}'
  type: local
- address: cosmos10swd7f4zygdd3txyqvsvcqp7n2gzhfl6ff66ru
  name: bob
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AjLL6Xsam9x2XFUyi1gEOGQtFOpzxgPy4NNyMaBknmv7"}'
  type: local
```

#### Set up Chain
```sh
$ simd init test --chain-id gov-demo 
```

The default voting period is 172800 seconds (2 days). This is too long to wait for the tutorial, so let's change it to 180 seconds (3 minutes). To do this, modify the file `~/.simapp/config/genesis.json`:
```sh
# v0.46
$ cat <<< $ (jq '.app_state.gov.voting_params.voting_period = "180s"' ~/.simapp/config/genesis.json) > ~/.simapp/config/genesis.json

# v0.47+
$ cat <<< $ (jq '.app_state.gov.params.voting_period = "180s"' ~/.simapp/config/genesis.json) > ~/.simapp/config/genesis.json
```

Add the remaining preferences:
```sh
$ simd genesis add-genesis-account alice 5000000000stake --keyring-backend test && 
simd genesis add-genesis-account bob 5000000000stake --keyring-backend test &&
simd genesis gentx alice 1000000stake --chain-id gov-demo &&
simd genesis collect-gentxs
```

Now start the chain:
```sh
$ simd start
```


To avoid copying and pasting user addresses when entering queries or transactional commands, it's a good idea to preset the user key as an accessible variable in the shell. 
```sh
$ export ALICE=$(simd keys show alice --address) && export BOB=$(simd keys show bob --address)
```

## 2. Creating a proposal
To create a file that describes your proposal in the proper format before sending something to the blockchain, you can use the following interactive command
```sh
$ simd tx gov draft-proposal
```

First, create a simple `text` proposal. A `text` proposal contains no message, only proposal metadata.
```sh
Use the arrow keys to navigate: ↓ ↑ → ←
? Select proposal type:
  ▸ text
    community-pool-spend
    software-upgrade
    cancel-software-upgrade
    other
```

Next, enter the information relevant to your proposal: 
```sh
# Enter the proposal title, author, and other proposal metadata
✔ text
✔ Enter proposal title: Test Proposal
✔ Enter proposal authors: Alice
✔ Enter proposal summary: A test proposal with simapp
✔ Enter proposal details: -
✔ Enter proposal proposal forum url: https://example.org/proposal/1█
✔ Enter proposal vote option context: YES: XX, NO: YX, ABSTAIN: XY, NO_WITH_VETO: YY

# Finally, enter the proposal deposit
✔ Enter proposal deposit: 10stake

Your draft proposal has successfully been generated.
Proposals should contain off-chain metadata, please upload the metadata JSON to IPFS.
Then, replace the generated metadata field with the IPFS CID.
```

The `draft-proposal` command has now created two files. 

#### draft_metadata.json
The contents of `draft_metadata.json` contains the information you just entered:
```json
{
 "title": "Test Proposal",
 "authors": [
  "Alice"
 ],
 "summary": "A test proposal with simapp",
 "details": "-",
 "proposal_forum_url": "https://example.org/proposal/1",
 "vote_option_context": "YES: XX, NO: YX, ABSTAIN: XY, NO_WITH_VETO: YY"
}%   
```
This metadata information should be [pinned to IPFS](https://tutorials.cosmos.network/tutorials/how-to-use-ipfs/). 

#### draft_proposal.json
Now let's take a look at the contents of the generated `draft_proposal.json`:
```json
{
 "metadata": "ipfs://CID",
 "deposit": "10stake",
 "title": "Test Proposal",
 "summary": "A test proposal with simapp"
}
```

Replace the metadata field with `ipfs://QmbmhY1eNXdmcVV8QPqV5enwLZm1mjH7iv8aYTQ4RJCH49`, which we uploaded beforehand.
```sh
cat draft_proposal.json
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```json
{
 "metadata": "ipfs://CID:",
 "deposit": "10stake",
 "title": "Test Proposal",
 "summary": "A test proposal with simapp"
}
```

#### submit-proposal Making an offer 
Submit a proposal from Alice to the chain:
```sh
$ simd tx gov submit-proposal draft_proposal.json --from alice --keyring-backend test
```

You can query and export the proposal ID via the executed transaction hash:
```sh
$ export PROPOSAL_ID=$(simd query tx 2FC731865C451A8876336B1D45A9065E0833F92D9EE12441CC46781A4EBEAA44 --output json | jq '.events' | jq -r '.[] | select(.type == "submit_proposal") | .attributes[0].value' | jq -r '.')
```

## 3. View and vote on a proposal
####  View a submitted proposal 
You can look up a proposal by its proposal ID with the following command:
```sh
$ simd query gov proposal $PROPOSAL_ID
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
deposit_end_time: "2024-07-05T19:06:59.986755Z"
final_tally_result:
  abstain_count: "0"
  no_count: "0"
  no_with_veto_count: "0"
  yes_count: "0"
id: "1"
messages: []
metadata: ipfs://QmbmhY1eNXdmcVV8QPqV5enwLZm1mjH7iv8aYTQ4RJCH49
proposer: cosmos1qprjna2rll8jnqht5wcqa76fufuha4vlag4r8n
status: PROPOSAL_STATUS_DEPOSIT_PERIOD
submit_time: "2024-07-03T19:06:59.986755Z"
summary: A test proposal with simapp
title: Test Proposal
total_deposit:
- amount: "10"
  denom: stake
voting_end_time: null
voting_start_time: null
```


#### Making a proposal minimum deposit 
A proposal is in the deposit period. This means that the deposits associated with the proposal have not yet reached the required minimum amount and therefore cannot be voted on yet. To find out what the minimum proposal deposit is for a chain, run the following command
```sh
$ simd query gov params --output json | jq .deposit_params.min_deposit
```
```json
[
  {
    "denom": "stake",
    "amount": "10000000"
  }
]
```

Therefore, since you initially submitted a proposal with `10 stake`, you need to top up the remaining deposit of `9999990 stake`. Let's deposit the remaining amount through Bob:
```sh
$ simd tx gov deposit $PROPOSAL_ID 9999990stake --from bob --keyring-backend test
```

Once the minimum deposit is met, the proposal enters the voting period. You have 3 minutes (180 seconds) to vote on the proposal.
```sh
$ simd query gov proposal $PROPOSAL_ID --output json | jq .status
# "PROPOSAL_STATUS_VOTING_PERIOD"
```

#### Vote on a GOV proposal 
You can vote with the following command
```sh
$ simd tx gov vote $PROPOSAL_ID yes --from alice --keyring-backend test
$ simd tx gov vote $PROPOSAL_ID no --from bob --keyring-backend test
```
> This means waiting three minutes for the poll to close.

#### Check the results of a GOV proposal  
After waiting for the voting period, you'll see that your proposal has passed:
```sh
$ simd query gov proposal $PROPOSAL_ID --output json | jq .status
# "PROPOSAL_STATUS_PASSED"
```

Alice's vote of 1 in favor and Bob's vote of 1 against passes because the governance proposal weights each vote based on the number of tokens staked. Alice owns staked tokens, while Bob had no staked tokens at the end of the voting period, so his vote was not considered in the tally.
```sh
$ simd query staking delegations $ALICE && simd query staking delegations $BOB
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample
```sh
# Alice
delegation_responses:
- balance:
    amount: "1000000"
    denom: stake
  delegation:
    delegator_address: cosmos1qprjna2rll8jnqht5wcqa76fufuha4vlag4r8n
    shares: "1000000.000000000000000000"
    validator_address: cosmosvaloper1qprjna2rll8jnqht5wcqa76fufuha4vlcupktq
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"

# Bob
delegation_responses: []
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

#### Checking Alice and Bob's balance 
After a governance proposal is executed, the deposit is refunded unless a weighted majority votes against it with a veto. You can check Alice and Bob's balances with the following commands
```sh
$ simd query bank balances $ALICE
$ simd query bank balances $BOB
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample
```sh
# Alice
balances:
- amount: "4999000000"
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"

# Bob
balances:
- amount: "5000000000"
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
- Alice was restored to all but the amount `1000000stake` used in the initial validator, while Bob was restored to his initial amount of `5000000000stake`.
