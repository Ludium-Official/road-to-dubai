## 0. Tendermint Core
[Tendermint Core](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) is a go implementation of the [BFT-based consensus algorithm introduced in 99c1](./99c2_tendermint_with_pos.md). The Tendermint core consists of two main technical components: The Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-based consensus algorithm and the Application Blockchain Interface (ABCI).
- The Tendermint consensus engine: It has an atomic nature that ensures that all nodes record the same transactions in the same order. This ensures the consistency of the blockchain.
- ABCI(Application Blockchain Interface): It is responsible for communication between the Tendermint core, where the consensus engine is implemented, and applications such as the Cosmos SDK. ABCI allows for the separation of the consensus layer from the application layer. This allows developers to implement application logic independently of the consensus algorithm.

ABCI is what we're going to learn more about today. 

## 1. ABCI (Application Blockchain Interface) 
ABCI is the communication interface between Tendermint core and applications. ABCI can run in the same process as Tendermint core or as a separate process.
- Running in the same process: In this case, Tendermint calls the methods of the ABCI application directly as Go method calls. This is favorable in terms of performance and simple to implement.
- Run in separate processes: In this case, the Tendermint core and the ABCI application run as independent processes. Tendermint opens four connections to communicate with the ABCI application. These connections serve different purposes and are of the following types
   - Consensus connection
   - Mempool connection
   - Info connection
   - Snapshot connection

This structure allows Tendermint to communicate with applications efficiently and flexibly in different situations.

## 2. ABCI Client-Server Structure
ABCI is essentially a client-server structure where the Tendermint core acts as a client to initiate a request and an application, such as the Cosmos SDK, acts as a server to respond with a response. Simply put, it is a method with a request/response format. 

### 1. Client
In ABCI communication, Tendermint works as a client by calling an application that is a server. Tendermint core implements a [gRPC client](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/abci/client/grpc_client.go) and a [socket client](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/abci/client/socket_client.go), and you can decide which client you want to communicate with depending on how you configure the initial setup.

Currently, there are two use cases for the ABCI client:
- One is a testing tool like abci-cli, which allows you to send ABCI requests via the command line. 
- The other is a consensus engine like Tendermint Core, which can send requests to applications whenever a new transaction is received or a block is committed. 

### 2. Server
Now that Tendermint has implemented an ABCI client, an ABCI server needs to be implemented at the application layer, such as the Cosmos SDK, that receives the requests. The application will use this as input to drive a state machine. If a consensus process is achieved, it receives input from the ABCI client as follows:
1. Validate the transaction via `CheckTx`.
2. When a new block is confirmed in the Tendermint core, `BeginBlock` is called with the block metadata. 3.
3. `DeliverTx` is called for each transaction in the block.
4. call `EndBlock` again with the block metadata. 
5. `Commit` is called to persist the resulting state to disk. 
> The detailed behavior of this request in an application can be found in [10_transaction_and_mempool](./10_transaction_and_mempool.md). 

Let's see how the application's ABCI server is defined based on the `simapp` implemented in the Cosmos SDK.

### 3. Implementing the ABCI Server
Since ABCI is just an interface, it's really up to you how you want to implement it. Tendermint suggests three basic implementations.
1. In-Process
2. gRPC
3. TSP(Tendermint Socket Protocol) 
> There is also a case of customizing ABCI with Narwhal and Bullshark consensus engines by customizing ABCI directly in the topic [Cosmos without Tendermint (Exploring Narwhal and Bullshark)](https://www.paradigm.xyz/2022/07/experiment-narwhal-bullshark-cosmos-stack) in Paradigm (FYI). 

#### 1. In-Process
Run your Go application and Tendermint core in the same process. This is the simplest approach. 
> See the [startInProcess cli method](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/server/start.go#L211-L421) implemented in the Cosmos SDK.

#### 2. gRPC
Client and server communicate using gRPC. Using [gRPC](./14_rpc_basic.md#3-grpc) may have performance overhead, but it can be easily implemented in various languages.
> See the [startStandAlone cli method](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/server/start.go#L171-L209) implemented in the Cosmos SDK.

#### 3. TSP (Tendermint Socket Protocol)
TSP is an asynchronous [raw socket server](./14_rpc_basic.md#1-1-socket) that delivers messages over Unix or TCP. If you need more performance or enjoy programming, you can use TSP to implement an ABCI server. Here is a basic implementation example 
- Messages are serialized as Protobuf3 and prefixed with a length.
- Messages encoded in proto3 are prefixed with a length prefix.

### 4. Sync vs Async 
#### Synchronous communication
Synchronous communication involves sending a request and waiting to receive a response. In this method, only one request can be processed at a time, and no other actions can be performed until the response is received. Because synchronous communication is sequential, the order of requests and responses is guaranteed.

#### Asynchronous communication
Asynchronous communication is a way to send a request and continue with other tasks without waiting for a response. You can send multiple requests at the same time, and each request is processed separately. Because you don't know when the response will arrive, there is no guarantee of order.

The main ABCI server (i.e., non-gRPC) provides ordered asynchronous messages, which allows Tendermint to deliver a new transaction to the application before the previous transaction finishes processing. This is especially useful for the `DeliverTx` and `CheckTx` messages. These two messages are sent asynchronously, allowing Tendermint to deliver multiple transactions to the application at the same time. This speeds up transaction processing and improves performance.


## 2. ABCI Methods
ABCI applications communicate with the application layer via the socket protocol, which is customized for each implementation. The [ABCI methods](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/spec/abci/abci.md) used for communication are of type Request, Response, and are organized as follows:
- Consensus Methods: `InitChain`, `BeginBlock`, `DeliverTx`, `EndBlock`, `Commit` Methods.
- Methods for validating transactions: `CheckTx`
- Query methods:  `Info`, `Query`, 
- Snapshot methods: `ListSnapshots`, `LoadSnapshotChunk`, `OfferSnapshot`, `ApplySnapshotChunk`

</div>

The [interface] for these methods(https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/abci/types/application.go#L7-L32) is defined as follows 
```go
type Application interface {
	// Info/Query Connection
	Info(RequestInfo) ResponseInfo                // Return application info
	SetOption(RequestSetOption) ResponseSetOption // Set application option
	Query(RequestQuery) ResponseQuery             // Query for state

	// Mempool Connection
	CheckTx(RequestCheckTx) ResponseCheckTx // Validate a tx for the mempool

	// Consensus Connection
	InitChain(RequestInitChain) ResponseInitChain    // Initialize blockchain w validators/other info from TendermintCore
	BeginBlock(RequestBeginBlock) ResponseBeginBlock // Signals the beginning of a block
	DeliverTx(RequestDeliverTx) ResponseDeliverTx    // Deliver a tx for full processing
	EndBlock(RequestEndBlock) ResponseEndBlock       // Signals the end of a block, returns changes to the validator set
	Commit() ResponseCommit                          // Commit the state and return the application Merkle root hash

	// State Sync Connection
	ListSnapshots(RequestListSnapshots) ResponseListSnapshots                // List available snapshots
	OfferSnapshot(RequestOfferSnapshot) ResponseOfferSnapshot                // Offer a snapshot to the application
	LoadSnapshotChunk(RequestLoadSnapshotChunk) ResponseLoadSnapshotChunk    // Load a snapshot chunk
	ApplySnapshotChunk(RequestApplySnapshotChunk) ResponseApplySnapshotChunk // Apply a shapshot chunk
}
```

#### Error Handling
The `Query`, `CheckTx`, and `DeliverTx` methods include a `Code` field in the response for error handling. A response code of 0 (`OK`) indicates no error. Any other response code indicates that an error occurred. It also returns a `Codespace` string that serves as a namespace for `Code` to the Tendermint consensus engine. This field is used to distinguish between `Code` values returned from different domains in the application. 

The `Echo`, `Info`, `InitChain`, `BeginBlock`, `EndBlock`, and `Commit` methods do not return errors. If an error occurs in one of these methods, it's a serious problem that Tendermint has no reasonable way to handle. If it does, the app will crash and the operator will have to deal with it manually. 

Let's take a closer look at the three methods that handle error handling: `Query`, `CheckTx`, and `DeliverTx`. `CheckTx` and `DeliverTx` are the core methods that play the most important role in ABCI because they check and execute transactions.

### 1. CheckTx Function
The `CheckTx` ABCI method passes the transaction to be included in the block from Tendermint to the application for validation. If Tendermint receives a `ResponseCheckTx` with a `Code` that is not of type `Ok`, the associated transaction is not added to Tendermint's mempool or removed if it is already included. The [implemented code](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/abci/types/application.go#L58-L60) looks like this
```go
// /abci/types/application.go
func (BaseApplication) CheckTx(req RequestCheckTx) ResponseCheckTx {
	return ResponseCheckTx{Code: CodeTypeOK}
}

// /abci/types/types.pb.go
type ResponseCheckTx struct {
	Code      uint32  `protobuf:"varint,1,opt,name=code,proto3" json:"code,omitempty"`
	Data      []byte  `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=data,proto3" json:"data,omitempty"`
	Log       string  `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=log,proto3" json:"log,omitempty"`
	Info      string  `protobuf:"bytes,4,opt,name=info,proto3" json:"info,omitempty"`
	GasWanted int64   `protobuf:"varint,5,opt,name=gas_wanted,proto3" json:"gas_wanted,omitempty"`
	GasUsed   int64   `protobuf:"varint,6,opt,name=gas_used,proto3" json:"gas_used,omitempty"`
	Events    []Event `protobuf:"bytes,7,rep,name=events,proto3" json:"events,omitempty"`
	Codespace string  `protobuf:"bytes,8,opt,name=codespace,proto3" json:"codespace,omitempty"`
	Sender    string  `protobuf:"bytes,9,opt,name=sender,proto3" json:"sender,omitempty"`
	Priority  int64   `protobuf:"varint,10,opt,name=priority,proto3" json:"priority,omitempty"`
	// mempool_error is set by Tendermint.
	// ABCI applictions creating a ResponseCheckTX should not set mempool_error.
	MempoolError string `protobuf:"bytes,11,opt,name=mempool_error,json=mempoolError,proto3" json:"mempool_error,omitempty"`
}
```

### 2.DeliverTx Function
The `DeliverTx` ABCI method delivers transactions from Tendermint to an application. Similar to `CheckTx`, the application receiving the transactions must validate each transaction received with the `DeliverTx` message against its current state, application protocol, and transaction cryptographic credentials. If the validation is successful, `DeliverTx` executes it directly. If Tendermint receives a `ResponseDeliverTx` containing a `Code` rather than an `Ok`, the response code is recorded. The code does not affect the Tendermint consensus because the transaction has already been included in the block. The [implemented code](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/abci/types/application.go#L54-L56) looks like this
```go
// /abci/types/application.go
func (BaseApplication) DeliverTx(req RequestDeliverTx) ResponseDeliverTx {
	return ResponseDeliverTx{Code: CodeTypeOK}
}

// /abci/types/types.pb.go
type ResponseDeliverTx struct {
	Code      uint32  `protobuf:"varint,1,opt,name=code,proto3" json:"code,omitempty"`
	Data      []byte  `protobuf:"bytes,2,opt,name=data,proto3" json:"data,omitempty"`
	Log       string  `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=log,proto3" json:"log,omitempty"`
	Info      string  `protobuf:"bytes,4,opt,name=info,proto3" json:"info,omitempty"`
	GasWanted int64   `protobuf:"varint,5,opt,name=gas_wanted,proto3" json:"gas_wanted,omitempty"`
	GasUsed   int64   `protobuf:"varint,6,opt,name=gas_used,proto3" json:"gas_used,omitempty"`
	Events    []Event `protobuf:"bytes,7,rep,name=events,proto3" json:"events,omitempty"`
	Codespace string  `protobuf:"bytes,8,opt,name=codespace,proto3" json:"codespace,omitempty"`
}
```

### 3. Query Function
The `Query` ABCI method is used to query for information about the state of the application. If Tendermint receives a `ResponseQuery` that contains a `Code` rather than an `Ok`, this code is returned directly to the client that initiated the query. The [implemented code](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/main/abci/types/application.go#L66-L68) looks like this
```go
// /abci/types/application.go
func (BaseApplication) Query(req RequestQuery) ResponseQuery {
	return ResponseQuery{Code: CodeTypeOK}
}

// /abci/types/types.pb.go
type ResponseQuery struct {
	Code uint32 `protobuf:"varint,1,opt,name=code,proto3" json:"code,omitempty"`
	// bytes data = 2; // use "value" instead.
	Log       string           `protobuf:"bytes,3,opt,name=log,proto3" json:"log,omitempty"`
	Info      string           `protobuf:"bytes,4,opt,name=info,proto3" json:"info,omitempty"`
	Index     int64            `protobuf:"varint,5,opt,name=index,proto3" json:"index,omitempty"`
	Key       []byte           `protobuf:"bytes,6,opt,name=key,proto3" json:"key,omitempty"`
	Value     []byte           `protobuf:"bytes,7,opt,name=value,proto3" json:"value,omitempty"`
	ProofOps  *crypto.ProofOps `protobuf:"bytes,8,opt,name=proof_ops,json=proofOps,proto3" json:"proof_ops,omitempty"`
	Height    int64            `protobuf:"varint,9,opt,name=height,proto3" json:"height,omitempty"`
	Codespace string           `protobuf:"bytes,10,opt,name=codespace,proto3" json:"codespace,omitempty"`
}
```
