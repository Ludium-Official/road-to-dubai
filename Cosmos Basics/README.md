The Cosmos Basic task will be carried out in the form of mainly posting short articles on each blog (if there is no such task).

The reason for doing this is that each learning time is not just a transfer of knowledge, but rather an internalization process that makes each person review and own.

It may be a cumbersome task at first, but I think solid thinking skills are needed for continuous development in this ecosystem where trends and technology are fast.
