# Auth module

## 0. The `auth` module
The [`auth` module](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.45.4/x/auth) is the most basic module used by Cosmos Hub. It is responsible for specifying the default transaction and account types. It contains middleware (anteHandler) where all basic transaction validation (signature, nonce, ancillary fields) is performed, and exposes an account keeper to allow other modules to read, write, and modify accounts.

The `auth` module is different from `authz`. The differences are as follows
- `auth`: account and transaction authentication for Cosmos SDK apps and provides the ability to specify the default transaction and account types. 
- `authz`: Authorization for an account to perform an action on behalf of another account, such as a grantor granting permission to a grantee to allow the grantee to execute a message on behalf of the grantor.

## 1. Status.
1. [accounts](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/proto/cosmos/auth/v1beta1/auth.proto#L10-L25): The account contains the authentication information of a uniquely identified external user, including pubKey, address, and account number/sequence number for replay protection. 
2. [vesting account](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/proto/cosmos/vesting/v1beta1/vesting.proto#L10-L33): This is [deprecated for `x/accounts` since v0.51](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/modules/auth/vesting).

## 2. Get status
### 1. get account
The [`account` command](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/x/auth/client/cli/query.go#L82-L112) can be used to query an account by address.
```sh
simd query auth account [address] [flags]
```

### 2. Query all accounts 
The [`accounts` command](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/x/auth/client/cli/query.go#L114-L144) allows you to query all available accounts.
```sh
simd query auth accounts [flags]
```

### 3. Querying params 
The [`params` command](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/x/auth/client/cli/query.go#L51-L80) allows you to query the current `auth` parameters.
```sh
simd query auth params [flags]
```

## 3.  State Conversion 
### 1. sign
The [`sign` command](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/x/auth/client/cli/tx_sign.go#L158-L192) can be used to sign transactions created offline.
```sh
simd tx sign [file]
```

An example command transaction looks like this:
```sh
simd tx sign tx.json --from $ALICE > tx.signed.json
```

### 2. sign-batch
The [`sign-batch` command](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/x/auth/client/cli/tx_sign.go#L24-L58) can be used to sign multiple transactions generated offline. The transactions can be contained in a single file or multiple files with one tx per line.
```sh
simd tx sign-batch [file]
```

An example command transaction looks like this:
```sh
simd tx sign-batch txs.json --from $ALICE > tx.signed.json
# or 
simd tx sign-batch tx1.json tx2.json tx3.json --from $ALICE > tx.signed.json
```

### 3. multi-sign
The [`multi-sign` command](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/x/auth/client/cli/tx_multisign.go#L33-L71) allows you to sign transactions created offline in a multi-signature account.
```sh
simd tx multisign [file] [name] [[signature]...]
```

An example command transaction looks like this:
```sh
simd tx multisign transaction.json k1k2k3 k1sig.json k2sig.json k3sig.json
```

### 4. multi-sign-batch
[The `multi-sign-batch` command](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/x/auth/client/cli/tx_multisign.go#L202-L234) is the multi-signature account version of `sign-batch`. The difference is that the `multi-sign-batch` command requires all transactions to be in one file and does not have the `--append` flag.
```sh
simd multisign-batch [file] [name] [[signature-file]...]
```

### 5. validate-signatures
The [`validate-signatures` command](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/x/auth/client/cli/validate_sigs.go#L16-L56) can be used to validate the signatures of signed transactions.
```sh
simd tx validate-signatures [file]
```

An example command transaction looks like this:
```sh
simd tx validate-signatures tx.signed.json

# Signers:
#  0: cosmos1l6vsqhh7rnwsyr2kyz3jjg3qduaz8gwgyl8275
#
# Signatures:
#   0: cosmos1l6vsqhh7rnwsyr2kyz3jjg3qduaz8gwgyl8275        
```   

### 6. broadcast
The `broadcast` command allows you to broadcast a signed transaction to the network.

An example command transaction is shown below:
```sh
simd tx broadcast tx.signed.json
```

## 4. Practice. 
### 4-1. Running simd
> If you have used `simd` before, you may already have a `.simapp` directory in your home directory. If you want to keep the old data, you must save the directory to a different location or use the `--home` flag to specify a different directory for each command. If you do not want to keep the old data, remove the old directory (`rm -rf ~/.simapp`).

Clone the cosmos-sdk repository and change the version to `v0.45.4`:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
$ cd cosmos-sdk && git checkout v0.45.4
```

Build the `simd` binary:
```sh
$ make install
```

Once the build is complete, verify with a version check that `simd` is working properly: 
```sh
$ simd version

0.45.4 # good!
```

#### Setting up a chain
Sets the chain ID:
```sh
$ simd config chain-id auth-demo 
```

Set the keyring-backend name:
```sh
$ simd config keyring-backend test 
```

#### Setting up keys
Create Alice and her friend Bob, who will act as validators:
```sh
$ simd keys add alice && simd keys add bob
```

Verify that the two keys were created successfully:
```sh
$ simd keys list
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
- name: alice
  type: local
  address: cosmos1jyuue3asacd6temmncd8kt9wxqamjypqgsdtyd
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A91xVaCh42lfDYUokCxygfwyrRS5ceb+oj1OL1p2S7Xn"}'
  mnemonic: ""
- name: bob
  type: local
  address: cosmos19jd7dgxha4uy4t0y5ytck3mc27672m83wy5r4k
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AtcJwjRRbOxWMZvBx5Uey98kMbmkncGBOIyruq+EQoxo"}'
  mnemonic: ""
```

####  Getting started with Chain
Add the remaining default settings:
```sh
$ simd init test --chain-id auth-demo   &&
simd add-genesis-account alice 1000500stake --keyring-backend test &&
simd gentx alice 1000000stake --chain-id auth-demo  &&
simd collect-gentxs
```

Now start the chain:
```sh
$ simd start
```
 
To avoid copying and pasting user addresses when entering queries or transactional commands, it's a good idea to preset the user key as an accessible variable in the shell. 
```sh
$ export ALICE=$(simd keys show alice --address) && export BOB=$(simd keys show bob --address)
```

### 4-2. Creating and signing transactions
### Creating a transaction
Create a transaction ([tx.Tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/types/tx/tx.pb.go#L31-L42)) for Alice to send `100stake` to Bob by hand in the file `tx.json`: 
- The transaction structure is divided into [body](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/types/tx/tx.pb.go#L247-L272), which holds the message array, and [auth_info](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/types/tx/tx.pb.go#L342-L355), which holds the signature information. 
```sh
echo '{
    "body": {
        "messages": [
        {
            "@type": "/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
            "from_address": "'"$ALICE"'",
            "to_address": "'"$BOB"'",
            "amount": [
                {
                    "denom": "stake",
                    "amount": "100"
                }
            ]
        }
        ],
        "memo": ""
    },
    "auth_info": {
        "signer_infos": [],
        "fee": {
            "amount": [
                {
                    "denom": "stake",
                    "amount": "1"
                }
            ],
            "gas_limit": "200000",
            "payer": "",
            "granter": ""
        }
    },
    "signatures": []
}' > tx.json
```
> `simd tx bank send $ALICE $BOB 100stake --generate-only > tx.json` You can also create them like this.


Verify that the transaction file was created successfully:
```sh
$ cat tx.json
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```json
{
    "body": {
        "messages": [
        {
            "@type": "/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
            "from_address": "cosmos1jyuue3asacd6temmncd8kt9wxqamjypqgsdtyd",
            "to_address": "cosmos19jd7dgxha4uy4t0y5ytck3mc27672m83wy5r4k",
            "amount": [
                {
                    "denom": "stake",
                    "amount": "100"
                }
            ]
        }
        ],
        "memo": ""
    },
    "auth_info": {
        "signer_infos": [],
        "fee": {
            "amount": [
                {
                    "denom": "stake",
                    "amount": "1"
                }
            ],
            "gas_limit": "200000",
            "payer": "",
            "granter": ""
        }
    },
    "signatures": []
}
```

### Signing the transaction 
Now use the `sign` command to add $Alice's signature information to `tx.json`. 
```sh
simd tx sign tx.json --keyring-backend test --chain-id auth-demo --from $ALICE > tx.signed.json
```
> If the signature information does not match, an error [`Error: tx intended signer does not match the given signer`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/types/errors/errors.go#L90-L91) is raised.


Check the balance before broadcasting the transaction:
```sh
simd query bank balances $ALICE && simd query bank balances $BOB
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
# Alice
- amount: "500"
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"

# Bob
balances: []
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

### 4-3. Broadcasting transactions
```sh
simd tx broadcast tx.signed.json
```


After the transaction is broadcast, verify that the state has changed properly:
```sh
simd query bank balances $ALICE && simd query bank balances $BOB
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
# Alice
balances:
- amount: "399"
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"

# Bob
balances:
- amount: "100"
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
- You can see that Alice's balance has been subtracted by `101 stake`, including fees, and Bob's balance has been added by `100 stakes`.
