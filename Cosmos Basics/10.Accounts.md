## 0. Public Key Cryptography 
Public key cryptography algorithms encrypt and decrypt data using a public key and a private key. This is also known as asymmetric key cryptography. The public key can be shared with anyone, but the private key must not be known to anyone. There are two types of cryptographic communication: digital signatures and encryption/decryption.

### Digital signatures
- Signature: The sender signs the message with his private key. This signature can be verified by anyone with the sender's public key.
- Verification: The Receiver verifies the signature using the Sender's public key. This verifies that the message came from the sender.

### Encryption/decryption communication
- Encryption: The sender encrypts the message with the receiver's public key. A message encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the private key of the receiver.
- Decryption: The receiver decrypts the encrypted message with its own private key. This ensures that the message is delivered securely.


### Blockchain use cases
Public-key cryptography is used in blockchains in a variety of ways:
- Signing and verifying transactions: You digitally sign a transaction with your private key, and other nodes in the network verify the signature using your public key. 
- Generate an address: Generate an address derived from your public key and make it public. Other users can refer to the user's address to send transactions. 

### Types of public key cryptography
There are many types of public key cryptography algorithms. Let's look at RSA and ECC, which are also used in SSL/TLS certificate encryption. 

#### 1. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
RSA is a public-key cryptographic algorithm based on the difficulty of prime factorization, invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman. The idea is to create a public key by multiplying two incredibly large prime numbers, so that a message cannot be decrypted without knowing the value of the prime number. It is the traditional public-key cryptography algorithm, proven and widely used. 

The reason for adopting RSA is that it is based on simple mathematical principles and can run faster than ECC. We'll explain what ECC is in a moment. However, the downside of its simplicity is that it requires a key size of 2048 bits or more for a high level of security. This vulnerability cannot be ignored as computer computing power is improving every day. 

#### 2. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
The history of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) can be traced back to two mathematicians, Neal Koblitz and Victor S. Miller, who proposed the use of elliptic curves in cryptography in 1985. It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm that uses the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. This encryption method is said to be harder to crack because there is no known solution to the mathematical problem given by the equations that generate elliptic curves in a graph. 

Therefore, ECC can provide higher security with a relatively smaller key size compared to RSA. For example, an ECC key of 256 bits is said to provide a similar level of security to an RSA key of 15360 bits. Many experts believe that RSA will become obsolete by 2030. ECC, on the other hand, is in a mature stage and is starting to be used by many users. The blockchain field, which uses digital signatures for transactions, has also adopted ECC, and the Cosmos SDK also uses ECC.

## 1. Account
Account is an object that contains a public key and a private key used in public key cryptography algorithms. As mentioned earlier, the public key represents a unique identifier of the user that is safe to disclose. The private key is used to prove to others that you signed it yourself and should be kept confidential. 
- The public key can be derived to generate various addresses that are used by applications to identify users.
- The address is also associated with messages to identify the message sender. 
- The private key is used to generate a digital signature, which proves that the address associated with the private key authorized a particular message.

For erarchical deterministic (HD) key generation, the Cosmos SDK uses a standard called BIP32. BIP32 allows users to create an HD wallet (as specified in BIP44), which is a set of accounts derived from an initial seed. 
- Seeds are typically generated as 12- or 24-word mnemonics. 
- A seed can derive any number of private keys using a one-way cryptographic function. The public key can then be derived from the private key. 
- Naturally, the mnemonic is the most sensitive information because the private key can be regenerated at any time if the mnemonic is preserved.

### Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets
[BIP32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0032) is a Bitcoin proposal document on the topic of Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets. 
- Blockchains typically maintain a ledger of user accounts and use public key cryptography for user authentication. To execute a transaction, a user needs information about their public key and private key. 
- A client app, known as a wallet, provides a way to generate and store new key pairs (public key, private key) and basic services such as creating transactions, signing messages, interacting with applications, and communicating with the blockchain.

</p>

After BIP39, this initial seed is generated from 12 or 24 words, called mnemonics, which are mostly taken from standardized dictionaries. Since mnemonics are deterministic, any key pair can be reconstructed as a mnemonic. So you only need to keep the mnemonic safe. There is no practical upper bound on the number of key pairs that can be generated from a single mnemonic. The input from the [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki) derivation path is used to generate key pairs for all blockchains using a single mnemonic, hence the name “Hierarchical Deterministic (HD)”. 

### Public Key
Cosmos SDK의 공개 키는 [`PubKey`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/crypto/types/types.go#L8-L17) 인터페이스에 의해 정의된다. 공개 키는 저장소에 저장되므로 이는 proto.Message 인터페이스를 확장한다.
```go
// PubKey defines a public key and extends proto.Message.
type PubKey interface {
	proto.Message

	Address() Address
	Bytes() []byte
	VerifySignature(msg []byte, sig []byte) bool
	Equals(PubKey) bool
	Type() string
}
```

For user interaction, the `PubKey` is formatted using Protobufs JSON (ProtoMarshalJSON function). Here is a function [`NewKeyOutput`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/crypto/keyring/output.go#L23-L39) that uses this approach: 
```go
// NewKeyOutput creates a default KeyOutput instance without Mnemonic, Threshold and PubKeys
func NewKeyOutput(name string, keyType keyring.KeyType, a sdk.Address, pk cryptotypes.PubKey) (KeyOutput, error) {
	apk, err := codectypes.NewAnyWithValue(pk)
	if err != nil {
		return KeyOutput{}, err
	}
	bz, err := codec.ProtoMarshalJSON(apk, nil)
	if err != nil {
		return KeyOutput{}, err
	}
	return KeyOutput{
		Name:    name,
		Type:    keyType.String(),
		Address: a.String(),
		PubKey:  string(bz),
	}, nil
}
```

### Private Key 
Private keys in the Cosmos SDK are defined by an interface called [`PrivKey`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/crypto/types/types.go#L19-L39). It extends the proto.Message interface and LedgerPrivKey:

```go
// LedgerPrivKey defines a private key that is not a proto message.
type LedgerPrivKey interface {
	Bytes() []byte
	Sign(msg []byte) ([]byte, error)
	PubKey() PubKey
	Equals(LedgerPrivKey) bool
	Type() string
}

// PrivKey defines a private key and extends proto.Message.
type PrivKey interface {
	proto.Message
	LedgerPrivKey
}
```

## 2. Signature
The Cosmos SDK supports the following digital key schemes for generating digital signatures. These are implemented for each algorithm by the `Sign(msg []byte) ([]byte, error)` function defined in the `PrivKey` interface:
- `secp256k1`: One of the elliptic curve digital signature algorithms (ECDSA), also used by Bitcoin. It is implemented in the Cosmos SDK in the package [`crypto/keys/secp256k1`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/crypto/keys/secp256k1/secp256k1.go).
- `secp256r1`: Another elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), commonly known as P-256 or prime256v1. It is implemented in the Cosmos SDK in the package [`crypto/keys/secp256r1`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/crypto/keys/secp256r1/pubkey.go).
- `tm-ed25519`: A digital signature algorithm that uses the elliptic curve ED25519. It is implemented in the Cosmos SDK [`crypto/keys/ed25519`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/crypto/keys/ed25519/ed25519.go) package.



## 3. Address
Both `Address` and `PubKey` are public information that identifies the actor in the application. `Account` is used to store authentication information. The basic account implementation is provided by the `BaseAccount` object.

Each account is identified using an `Address`, which is a sequence of bytes derived from the public key. The Cosmos SDK defines three types of addresses that specify the context in which the account is used:
- [`AccAddress`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/types/address.go#L132) identifies the user (message sender).
  - It is represented as a string using Bech32. It is used for general money transfers, transferring assets between accounts, interacting with smart contracts, etc.
- [`ValAddress`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/types/address.go#L316) identifies the validator node that performs the validation.
  - It is represented as a string using Bech32. It is used for validator registration, staking, validator voting, etc.
- [`ConsAddress`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/types/address.go#L466) identifies the node that participates in the consensus.
  - It is represented as a string using Bech32. It is used in the consensus algorithm for block signing and validator consensus procedures.

These types implement the [`Address`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/types/address.go#L108-L117) interface:
```go
type Address interface {
	Equals(Address) bool
	Empty() bool
	Marshal() ([]byte, error)
	MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
	Bytes() []byte
	String() string
	Format(s fmt.State, verb rune)
}
```
- Note that both the `Marshal()` and `Bytes()` methods return addresses in the same raw `[]byte` format. `Marshal()` is required for Protobuf compatibility.

### Create AccAccount with public key 
The address construction algorithm is defined in [ADR-28](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-028-public-key-addresses.md). The following is the standard way to obtain an account address from a `pub` public key:
```go
sdk.AccAddress(pub.Address().Bytes())
```

### Getting an Account 
Addresses for user interaction are formatted using [Bech32](http://wiki1.kr/index.php/Bech32) and implemented as [String methods](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/types/address.go#L281-L295). Bech32 methods are the only supported format that can be used when interacting with the blockchain. The Bech32 human-readable part (the Bech32 prefix) is used to indicate the type of address.

## 4. Keyring
In the Cosmos SDK, keys are stored and managed using an object called a [`Keyring`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/crypto/keyring/keyring.go#L53-L101). This can store and manage multiple accounts. 

When a user creates a key with the following command: [`addKey`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.0-alpha.0/client/keys/add.go), it is managed by the `Keyring` object: 
```sh
simd keys add <name>
```
