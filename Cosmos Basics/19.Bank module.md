# Bank module

## 0. The `bank` module
The [`bank` module](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.45.4/x/bank) handles multi-asset coin transfers between accounts and tracks pseudo-transfers in special cases where certain kinds of accounts need to behave differently (especially delegation/undelegation for vesting accounts). It exposes several interfaces with different functions for secure interaction with other modules that need to change user balances.

The `bank` module also keeps track of the total supply of all assets used in the application and provides query support. This module is being used in Cosmos Hub. 

## 1. Status
1. [Balance](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/proto/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/genesis.proto#L27-L39): Manages the token balance status of an account.
2. [Denomination metadata](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/proto/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/bank.proto#L61-L96): Manages the status of token denomination information. 
3. [Supply](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/proto/cosmos/bank/v1beta1/genesis.proto#L27-L39): Manages the status of the total supply of tokens.


## 2. Get status
### 1. Get balance
You can use [`balances` command](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/x/bank/client/cli/query.go#L41-L102) to search account balance by address.
```sh
simd query bank balances [address] [flags]
```
 
An example command query looks like this:
```sh
simd query bank balances cosmos1..
```

### 2. Get denom-metadata 
The [`denom-metadata` command](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/x/bank/client/cli/query.go#L104-L156) can be used to query metadata about the denominations of a given token. Users can query metadata for a single denomination using the `--denom` flag, or for all denominations without the flag.
```sh
simd query bank denom-metadata [flags]
```

An example command query looks like this:
```sh
simd query bank denom-metadata --denom stake
```


### 4. Get total 
The [`total` command](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/x/bank/client/cli/query.go#L158-L214) can be used to query the total supply of a token. 
- The `--denom` flag: you can query the total supply of the corresponding token, or you can query the supply of all tokens without the flag.
```sh
simd query bank total [flags]
```

An example command query looks like this:
```sh
simd query bank total --denom stake
```

## 3. State Transitions (transcation)
### 1. send 
The [`send` command](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/x/bank/client/cli/tx.go#L28-L60) allows you to send funds from one account to another.
```sh
simd tx bank send [from_key_or_address] [to_address] [amount] [flags]
```

An example command transaction looks like this:
```sh
simd tx bank send cosmos1.. cosmos1.. 100stake
```

### 2. multi-send 
This command is available in v0.46.0 and later. The [`multi-send` command](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.0/x/bank/client/cli/tx.go#L73-L145) is a command that has been added for a better UX experience and allows you to send funds from one account to multiple other accounts.
```sh
simd tx bank multi-send [from_key_or_address] [to_address_1, to_address_2, ...] [amount]
```

An example command transaction looks like this:
```sh
simd tx bank multi-send cosmos1.. cosmos1..,cosmos1..,cosmos1.. 100stake
```

## 4. Practice
This lab covers the ability to send a simple token between users. 

### 1. Getting started with simd 
> If you have used `simd` before, you may already have a `.simapp` directory in your home directory. If you want to keep the old data, you must save the directory to a different location or use the `--home` flag to specify a different directory for each command. If you do not want to keep the old data, remove the old directory (`rm -rf ~/.simapp`).

Clone the cosmos-sdk repository and change the version to `v0.45.4`:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
$ cd cosmos-sdk && git checkout v0.45.4
```

`simd` Build the binary:
```sh
$ make install
```

Once the build is complete, verify with a version check that `simd` is working properly: 
```sh
$ simd version

0.45.4 # good!
```

#### Setting up a chain
Sets the chain ID:
```sh
$ simd config chain-id bank-demo 
```

Set the keyring-backend name:
```sh
$ simd config keyring-backend test 
```

#### Setting up the key
Create Alice, who acts as a validator, and Bob and Charles, who each have their own token: 
```sh
$ simd keys add alice && simd keys add bob && simd keys add charles
```

Verify that the two keys were created successfully:
```sh
$ simd keys list
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
- name: alice
  type: local
  address: cosmos1d2dkkkfm2wkwsmwqezpl36de6gs2ed2tmdx984
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AuB2P0+kIUUMJ35stzpHcYwDfSredsYMiL0fldGGEOzD"}'
  mnemonic: ""
- name: bob
  type: local
  address: cosmos1s2v3q8l4hdpz925sjgjpxjp2ftmp5ftygkz47e
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A1Q9xqXVl5Q79b8tElcIQ+uoyx7wbOrKUXQtVrzO8S6Q"}'
  mnemonic: ""
- name: charles
  type: local
  address: cosmos1d2csszycpwwu50rxnm79yucq0m9mc8mxgsrm64
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AyQhF0KhQM+95B86aLWKieLfk3DkfULpnYBWx/Yt9lEb"}'
  mnemonic: ""
```

#### Getting started with Chain
Add the remaining default settings:
```sh
$ simd init test --chain-id bank-demo   &&
simd add-genesis-account alice 5000000000stake --keyring-backend test &&
simd add-genesis-account bob 10000kudos --keyring-backend test &&
simd add-genesis-account charles 10000bang --keyring-backend test &&
simd gentx alice 1000000stake --chain-id bank-demo  &&
simd collect-gentxs
```

Now start the chain:
```sh
$ simd start
```

To avoid copying and pasting user addresses when entering queries or transactional commands, it's a good idea to preset the user key as an accessible variable in the shell. 
```sh
$ export ALICE=$(simd keys show alice --address) && export BOB=$(simd keys show bob --address) && export CHARLES=$(simd keys show charles --address)
```

### 2. Transferring tokens
#### check balance
Before sending tokens, let's check the balance of each of your friends:
```sh
simd query bank balances $ALICE && simd query bank balances $BOB && simd query bank balances $CHARLES
``` 

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
# alice
balances:
- amount: "4999000000"
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
# bob
balances:
- amount: "10000"
  denom: kudos
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
# charles
balances:
- amount: "10000"
  denom: bang
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```


#### Sending tokens 
Use the `send` command to send a `send` transaction command to each of them like this:
```sh
$ simd tx bank send $ALICE $BOB 100stake
$ simd tx bank send $BOB $ALICE 1000kudos
$ simd tx bank send $CHARLES $BOB 500bang
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
# alice
balances:
- amount: "1000"
  denom: kudos
- amount: "4998999900"
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
# bob
balances:
- amount: "500"
  denom: bang
- amount: "9000"
  denom: kudos
- amount: "100"
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
# charles
balances:
- amount: "9500"
  denom: bang
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
- We can see that the transactions Alice sends `100stake` to Bob, Bob sends `1000kudos` to Alice, and Charles sends `500bang` to Bob are all successful.
