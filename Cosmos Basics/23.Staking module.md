# Staking module

## 0. `staking` module
The `staking` module supports Proof of Stake (PoS) functionality. Holders of the chain's primary staking token can become validators, and can delegate tokens to validators, ultimately determining the effective set of validators for the system. This module is used by the Cosmos Hub, the first hub of the Cosmos network.

## 1. Status
1. [`Pool`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/proto/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/staking.proto#L370-L389): Manages the overall information about the deposited tokens. It tracks the supply of bonded and unbonded tokens.
2. [`LastTotalPower`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/proto/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/genesis.proto#L16-L22): Stores the total power of reserved tokens recorded during the previous endblock. Storage entries prefixed with “Last” should only change state between endblocks.
3. [`UnbondingID`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/proto/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/staking.proto#L257): Stores the ID for the most recent unbonding that occurred, i.e., each time a new operation involving a deposited token (validator's de-delegation of a deposited token, delegator's de-delegation of a deposited token, redelegation) occurs, the `UnbondingID` is incremented to create a unique ID for the unbonding operation. 
4. [`Params`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/proto/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/staking.proto#L310-L333): The `staking` module stores parameters with a prefix of `0x51`, which can be updated with a governance or authorized address.
5. [`Validator`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/proto/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/staking.proto#L82-L138): A validator can have three states: `Bonded`, `Unbonded`, and `Unbonding`. 
6. [`Delegation`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/proto/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/staking.proto#L198-L216): A delegation is identified by combining `DelegatorAddr` and `ValidatorAddr`. 
7. [`UnbondingDelegation`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/proto/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/staking.proto#L198-L216): A delegated token can be unbonded, but a period of time is required to allow the token to be slashed if Byzantine behavior is detected. 
8. [`Redelegation`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/proto/cosmos/staking/v1beta1/staking.proto#L198-L216): A delegated token can be immediately redelegated from the current validator to another validator (target validator). However, this must be tracked in the redelegation object, and if the token contributed to a Byzantine error committed by the current validator, its stake may be reduced.

## 2. Validator states and state transitions 
### 1. Status 
#### `Unbonded`
Indicates that the validator is not part of the active set. 
- Can be delegated tokens from delegators.
- Cannot sign blocks and cannot receive rewards. 

#### `Bonded`
When a validator receives enough deposited tokens, it automatically joins the active set during `EndBlock` and its status is updated to `Bonded`. 
- It can sign blocks and receive rewards. 
- They can delegate additional tokens. 
- Deposits may be slashed for misbehavior that impedes liveness. (slashing)

#### `Unbonding`
If a validator is removed from the active set, either voluntarily or involuntarily, by slashing, confinement, or tombstone, all delegated deposits will be unbonded. All delegators must then wait for the unbonding time (`UnbondingTime`) before tokens are moved from the `BondedPool` to their accounts. If a validator is found to have done something inappropriate with a delegator's tokens that were deposited before they were un-delegated, they may still be slashed while waiting to be un-delegated.

### 2. State Transitions 
The validator's state transitions are performed by checking the active `ValidaotorSet` set for changes in the `EndBlock`. 
- The validator can be in the `Unbounded`, `Unbonding`, or `Bonded` state. 
- Unbonded, Unbonding, and Unbonded are collectively referred to as `Not Bonded'. 
- A validator can move directly between all states except (`Bonded` → `Unbonded`).
- Jail 🔁 Unjail: When a validator is jailed, it is removed from the CometBFT set. This process can go both ways. 


## 3. State lookup
Let's briefly list what state information is retrieved by the `staking` module:

## 6. State Transformations
Let's take a quick look at a list of what state transitions the `staking` module causes:
1. create-validator: [tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/staking#create-validator)
2. delegate: [tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/staking#delegate-1)
3. edit-validator: [tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/staking#edit-validator)
4. redelegate: [tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/staking#redelegate)
5. unbond: [tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/staking#unbond)
6. cancel unbond: [tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/staking#cancel-unbond)
7. rotate cons pubkey: [tx](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/main/x/staking#rotate-cons-pubkey)

## 4. Practice 
In this practice, you will understand the relationship between validators and delegators by participating as a validator and delegating and revoking tokens as a delegator. 


### 1. Run simd 
> If you have used `simd` before, you may already have a `.simapp` directory in your home directory. If you want to keep the old data, you must save the directory to a different location or use the `--home` flag to specify a different directory for each command. If you do not want to keep the old data, remove the old directory (`rm -rf ~/.simapp && rm -rf ~/.simd-bob`).


Clone the cosmos-sdk repository and change the version to `v0.45.4`:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
$ cd cosmos-sdk && git checkout v0.45.4
```

Build the `simd` binary:
```sh
$ make install
```

Once the build is complete, verify with a version check that `simd` is working properly: 
```sh
$ simd version

0.45.4 # good!
```


#### Setting up a chain
Sets the chain ID
```sh
$ simd config chain-id staking-demo
```

Set the keyring-backend name:
```sh
$ simd config keyring-backend test 
```

#### Setting up the key
Create alice to act as validator and bob and charles to act as delegators:
```sh
$ simd keys add alice && simd keys add bob && simd keys add charles
```

```sh
$ simd keys list
```

```sh
- name: alice
  type: local
  address: cosmos1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0syk8w6y3
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AsjlT55xZlxtl9eqk39bXDCoqIV3EWMidzCOBJpDuxD0"}'
  mnemonic: ""
- name: bob
  type: local
  address: cosmos1kztp9mle077sjerhrj49zqlt9te2sv9gsafhs7
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"Agr8hi52jrGpMB9h2kzG1SS0+4ScIwdFQBfnBdnuz6lb"}'
  mnemonic: ""
- name: charles
  type: local
  address: cosmos1h8d0cdf55qvmcm3xpmvklh95m053qq4m7xzmzx
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A+FXq8BR0gwCOYxaJLnPAaDOwO81gtTWNBOFXCYK/gRI"}'
  mnemonic: ""
```

#### Getting started with Chain
Add the remaining default settings:
```sh
$ simd init test --chain-id staking-demo &&
simd add-genesis-account alice 1000000000stake --keyring-backend test &&
simd add-genesis-account bob 500000000stake --keyring-backend test &&
simd add-genesis-account charles 500000000stake --keyring-backend test && 
simd gentx alice 1000000stake --chain-id staking-demo && 
simd collect-gentxs
```

Now start the chain:
```sh
$ simd start
```

To avoid copying and pasting user addresses when entering queries or transactional commands, it's a good idea to preset the user key as an accessible variable in the shell. 
```sh
$ export ALICE=$(simd keys show alice --address) && 
export ALICE_VAL=$(simd keys show alice --bech val --address) &&
export BOB=$(simd keys show bob --address) && 
export CHARLES=$(simd keys show charles --address)
```

### 2. Delegating tokens to validators 
#### Look up Alice validator 
Alice was set as the initial validator during the network initialization process when starting the app. So let's query Alice for her validator information:
```sh
$ simd query staking validator $ALICE_VAL && 
simd query staking delegations-to $ALICE_VAL
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample
```sh
# simd query staking validator $ALICE_VAL
commission:
  commission_rates:
    max_change_rate: "0.010000000000000000"
    max_rate: "0.200000000000000000"
    rate: "0.100000000000000000"
  update_time: "2024-07-04T16:18:19.881014Z"
consensus_pubkey:
  '@type': /cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey
  key: fJxptFMZIv+MPmI1hMHPzK016iwLrk1YhMBvub1NqUQ=
delegator_shares: "1000000.000000000000000000"
description:
  details: ""
  identity: ""
  moniker: test
  security_contact: ""
  website: ""
jailed: false
min_self_delegation: "1"
operator_address: cosmosvaloper1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0synn60gz
status: BOND_STATUS_BONDED
tokens: "1000000"
unbonding_height: "0"
unbonding_time: "1970-01-01T00:00:00Z"

# simd query staking delegations-to $ALICE_VAL
delegation_responses:
- balance:
    amount: "1000000"
    denom: stake
  delegation:
    delegator_address: cosmos1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0syk8w6y3
    shares: "1000000.000000000000000000"
    validator_address: cosmosvaloper1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0synn60gz
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

#### Delegating tokens 
Bob and Charles delegate a token to Alice's validator address:
```sh
$ simd tx staking delegate $ALICE_VAL 100000stake --from=bob
$ simd tx staking delegate $ALICE_VAL 200000stake --from=charles
```

Let's check the Alice validator information again after delegation:
```sh
$ simd query staking validator $ALICE_VAL && 
simd query staking delegations-to $ALICE_VAL
```

The result of the lookup should look like this :
```sh
# simd query staking validator $ALICE_VAL
commission:
  commission_rates:
    max_change_rate: "0.010000000000000000"
    max_rate: "0.200000000000000000"
    rate: "0.100000000000000000"
  update_time: "2024-07-04T16:18:19.881014Z"
consensus_pubkey:
  '@type': /cosmos.crypto.ed25519.PubKey
  key: fJxptFMZIv+MPmI1hMHPzK016iwLrk1YhMBvub1NqUQ=
delegator_shares: "1300000.000000000000000000"

delegation_responses:
- balance:
    amount: "1000000"
    denom: stake
  delegation:
    delegator_address: cosmos1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0syk8w6y3

    validator_address: cosmosvaloper1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0synn60gz
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

### 3. Modifying verifier information
Let's modify Alice's verifier information by modifying her moniker:
```sh
$ simd tx staking edit-validator --moniker="new-alice-validator" --from=alice
```

If you look it up, you'll see that it's changed just fine. 
```sh
$ simd query staking validator $ALICE_VAL | grep moniker
moniker: new-alice-validator # good!
```
- You can see the flags that can be changed by running the `simd tx staking edit-validator --help` command.

### 4. Compensation and equity interests
#### Change in stake due to reward application 
A validator has a number of tokens, T, and a number of shares, S, issued. 
- `T = S + reward - sliced tokens`.
- Each $Delegator_i$ holds a number of shares $S_i$. 

A delegator is entitled to a reward equal to $T * S_i / S$, proportional to their shareholding. 

And when a delegator delegates new tokens to a validator, the delegator will receive a number of shares proportional to their contribution. 
- So if delegator j delegates $T_j$ tokens, he will receive $S_j = S * T_j / T$ shares. 
- Now the total number of tokens is $T + T_j$ and the total number of shares is $S + S_j$. 
- The share percentage of j is equal to the percentage of the total tokens contributed: $(S + S_j) / S = (T + T_j) / T$, i.e., the share is proportional to the total number of tokens.

Let's assume that we received `50000stake` tokens as a virtual reward, and manually add a reward to Bob at random and observe how much the stake increases with the number of tokens. 
```sh
# Example: Add 50,000 stake as a reward for Bob
$ simd tx staking delegate $ALICE_VAL 50000stake --from=bob
```


#### Verifying Alice validator delegation information 
After the token is added, let's double-check the information delegated to the Alice validator:
```sh
$ simd query staking delegations-to $ALICE_VAL
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
delegation_responses:
- balance:
    amount: "1000000"
    denom: stake
  delegation:
    delegator_address: cosmos1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0syk8w6y3
    shares: "1000000.000000000000000000"
    validator_address: cosmosvaloper1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0synn60gz
- balance: # Bob!
    amount: "150000" 
    denom: stake
  delegation:
    delegator_address: cosmos1kztp9mle077sjerhrj49zqlt9te2sv9gsafhs7
    shares: "150000.000000000000000000"
    validator_address: cosmosvaloper1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0synn60gz
- balance:
    amount: "200000"
    denom: stake
  delegation:
    delegator_address: cosmos1h8d0cdf55qvmcm3xpmvklh95m053qq4m7xzmzx
    shares: "200000.000000000000000000"
    validator_address: cosmosvaloper1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0synn60gz
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
-Notice that Bob's share also increased by 1:1, proportional to the amount of tokens added. 
- This is the initial delegation, and since T = 0 and S = 0, $T_j / T$ is undefined, so delegator j, who delegated $T_j$ tokens, receives $S_j = T_j$ shares. Therefore, an unrewarded, unslashed validator has T = S.


### 5. Revoking a token delegation
The `unbond` command also allows Bob to revoke a token from Alice.
```sh
$ simd tx staking unbond $ALICE_VAL 100000stake --from=bob
```

#### Verifying Alice validator delegation information 
After the token is added, let's double-check the information delegated to the Alice validator:
```sh
$ simd query staking delegations-to $ALICE_VAL
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
delegation_responses:
- balance:
    amount: "1000000":
    denom: stake
  delegation:
    delegator_address: cosmos1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0syk8w6y3
    shares: "1000000.000000000000000000"
    validator_address: cosmosvaloper1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0synn60gz
- balance:
    amount: "50000"
    denom: stake
  delegation:
    delegator_address: cosmos1kztp9mle077sjerhrj49zqlt9te2sv9gsafhs7
    shares: "50000.000000000000000000"
    validator_address: cosmosvaloper1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0synn60gz
- balance:
    amount: "200000"
    denom: stake
  delegation:
    delegator_address: cosmos1h8d0cdf55qvmcm3xpmvklh95m053qq4m7xzmzx
    shares: "200000.000000000000000000"
    validator_address: cosmosvaloper1qjfvucv56atm3pam8pxf8kxgnf8mm0synn60gz
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
- You can see that Bob's token `100000stake` has decreased to `50000stake`, and his shareholding has decreased accordingly at a 1:1 ratio.
