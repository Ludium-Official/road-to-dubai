# Tendermint and BFT (Byzantine Fault Tolerance) 

## 0. Tendermint  w/ BFT
### Tendermint  
[Tendermint](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint) is a consensus algorithm with Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT) and a consensus engine. It allows multiple nodes to synchronize and replicate application state. It also ensures that the application can function properly in Byzantine environments where malicious nodes exist. This is why it is also known as a Replicated Statem Machine with BFT. Tendermint's features include 
- Tendermint is a consensus engine that includes a BFT-based consensus algorithm and a network layer.
- Tendermint itself is a private (or consortium) or organization-specific solution. It's high-performance enough to compete with the major non-BFT consensus solutions available today, such as etcd, consul, and zookeeper. As such, it can be used for private blockchain purposes as long as the functionality itself is used. 
- Cosmos Hub, the first public blockchain to use Tendermint, utilizes the [`x/staking`](./26_module_staking.md ) and [`x/slashing`](./27_module_slashing.md ) modules of the Cosmos-SDK to make it publicly available. The result is a robust blockchain application environment with crucial safety features added to the PoS consensus mechanism. However, it is important to note that due to the excessive amount of communication that is characteristic of PBFT-based systems, it is designed to limit or delegate the maximum number of participating validators when operating as a public blockchain. This is covered in detail in [tendermint_with_pos](./99c2_tendermint_with_pos.md). 

### BFT-based chain
In the [previous article](./28.PBFT%EC%99%80-POW-%ED%95%A9%EC%9D%98-%EC%95%8C%EA%B3%A0%EB%A6%AC%EC%A6%98.md), we briefly reviewed PoW and PBFT, and learned that PoW's excessive energy usage led to the creation of algorithms such as PoS, and Tendermint is one of the BFT-based chains.  PBFT is one of the BFT-based consensus algorithms designed to prevent malicious nodes from disrupting the system. This allows for reliability within a decentralized network and efficient consensus among network participants. Tendermint shares many similar characteristics with PBFT. Like PBFT, Tendermint aims for Byzantine fault tolerance and relies on trust among network participants to achieve consensus. The key features of Tendermint compared to PBFT can be summarized as follows
- Consensus process: Both PBFT and Tendermint achieve consensus through multiple rounds. In each round, validators exchange messages to confirm consensus.
- Reliability: Both algorithms are designed to achieve consensus even if up to 1/3 of the pool nodes are malicious.
- Performance: PBFT and Tendermint offer high performance and fast consensus, but at the cost of higher communication costs in the network. Tendermint includes an optimized communication mechanism to compensate for this.

In this way, Tendermint inherits the advantages of PBFT and provides a secure and reliable blockchain consensus algorithm based on BFT. In this article, we'll take a look at how Tendermint solved the BFT problem. 

### Tendermint Consensus Protocol 
The Tendermint consensus protocol works with a round-based voting mechanism that creates a consensus:
1. round start: validators propose blocks. 2. voting process: new blocks are proposed.
2. the voting process: a three-step process of signing to commit a new block. There are three types of votes: prevote, precommit, and commit.

</div> </div>

The round-based mechanism creates a secure State Replication Machine (SMR) for atomic broadcasts (transaction ordering) with added accountability and provides strong safety. 

### Minimum number of validator nodes required for consensus: 3f+1
Tendermint works on the premise that when the number of Byzantine nodes is at most f, like PBFT, the total number of network nodes is 3f+1. [Why 3f+1 is needed](./99c0_pbft_and_pow.md#Minimum-nodes-needed-for-consensus-3f1) is discussed in PBFT. In the worst-case scenario, at least 3f+1 nodes will eventually be required to achieve a normal consensus. 

## 1. Round-based mechanism 
At each height of the blockchain, a round-based protocol runs to determine the next block. 
- Each round consists of three phases (propose, prevote, precommit) and two special phases: commit and NewHeight.
- The result of a round is either a commit or a decision to move on to the next round. 
- When a new round starts, the next proponent appears. Using multiple rounds gives validators multiple chances to reach consensus in the event of network asynchronization or validator failure.

### 1. Proposal
Each round begins with a proposal. The proposer in a given round takes a batch of recently received transactions from the [Mempool](./10_transaction_and_mempool.md#1-mempool), constructs a block, and broadcasts a signed ProposalMsg containing the block. 
- If the proposer is Byzantine, it can broadcast different proposals to different validators. 
- Proposers are sorted through a simple, deterministic round robin, so that only one proposal is valid in a given round and all validators know the correct proposal. If a proposal is received from a lower round or from the wrong proposer, it is rejected.


Tendermint uses voting and locking mechanisms to maintain security, and rotates proposers to keep them active, so if one person doesn't process a transaction, someone else can. More interestingly, validators can vote through the [gov module](./25_module_gov.md) to remove or replace Byzantine validators.

#### Electing a leader every round 
Byzantine acceptance requires a rotation of proposers. If the leader elected during the RAFT consensus process, which does not take into account the distant Byzantine environment, is Byzantine and maintains strong network connections to other nodes, the system can be completely corrupted, destroying all safety and liveness guarantees. Therefore, unlike non-BFT consensus algorithms(ex. raft), which elect a new leader in the event of a failure, Tendermint elects a new leader (proposer) every round. Validators vote to skip to the next round in the same way as they vote to accept a proposal. 

#### Weak Synchronization (Partial Synchronization)
In the Tendermint consensus protocol, block proposals are made with weak synchronization. Proposers rely on local clocks to determine the proposal time and each round is asynchronous, reducing the dependency on synchronized clocks or limited network latency while ensuring the safety and liveness of the network. It has the following features
- Proposer skipping: If a validator does not receive a proposal within the locally measured TimeoutPropose of entering a new round, they can vote to skip the proposer.
- Asynchronous voting: The post-proposal round is asynchronous, where a validator can only proceed after hearing from at least 2/3 of the other validators. This mitigates the dependency on synchronized clocks or limited network latency, but can cause network outages if more than 1/3 of the validators don't respond, which can significantly reduce liveness.

### 2. Two-phase voting (Prevote, Precommit)
#### 1. Prevote Phase
- Validation and voting: Each validator validates a block upon receiving a ProposalMsg, signs a prevote for that proposal, and broadcasts it to the network. If a validator does not receive a valid proposal within the proposal time, it sends an invalid prevote.
- Polka: More than 2/3 of the prevotes for a single block in a given round are called polkas. When a validator receives a polka, it signals that the network is ready to commit the block.

#### 2. Precommit Phase
- Vote: The validator signs a precommit based on the polka and broadcasts it to the network.
- Commit: If a validator receives 2/3 or more precommits for a single block, it commits the block. If it does not receive 2/3 or more precommits, it sends an invalid precommit and moves on to the next round.

## 2. Lock
The lock mechanism consists of two rules: Prevote-the-Lock and Unlock-on-Polka. After a validator prevotes for a block, it locks the block and verifies the lock during the precommit phase to maintain the consistency of the blockchain. The importance of the lock mechanism is to
- Ensures safety: By locking the block that a validator prevotes and verifying this lock during the pre-commit phase, the network can prevent two or more different blocks from being committed simultaneously. This plays an important role in ensuring the safety of the network even in the presence of Byzantine validators.
- Maintaining Liveness: The lock mechanism allows validators to unlock (Unlock-on-Polka) only when certain conditions are met, allowing the network to continue generating new blocks without deadlocking. This plays an important role in maintaining the network's liveness.
- Information Verification: While single voting allows validators to verify what they know about a proposal, it's difficult to verify what other validators profess to know about a proposal. The lock mechanism allows validators to see which blocks have been locked by other validators, helping to maintain consistency in the network.

### 1. Prevote-the-Lock
Validators must prevote on blocks they have locked, or propose if they are the proposer. This prevents validators from compromising safety by precommitting a block in one round and then contributing to the polka of another block in the next round.

#### Prevote-the-Lock Scenario
To better understand why Prevote-the-Lock is needed, let's look at an example. 
- Validators: A, B, C, D
- Round R: Block B1 proposal
- Initial situation scenario:
   - A polka for B1 is accepted with a 2/3 majority.
   - a does not see this and precommits nil. 
   - b, c, and d precommit B1 as normal. 
   - Now assume that only d can see all the precommits, and the other validators do not see d's precommit (they can only see their own precommit and a's nil precommit).

Progression scenario: 
- D commits block B1 and the other validators move to round R+1.
- In the new round, a new proposer can propose and vote on block B2.

In this scenario, the lock forces the validators to stick to the block they precommitted, since they may have committed based on the precommit. This means that if more than 2/3 of the validators in a round precommit a block, the network is locked into that block, and it's impossible to generate a valid polka for another block in a higher round. This is the direct motivation for Prevote-the-Lock.


### 2. Unlock-on-Polka
A validator can only unlock a lock after verifying a polka at a round higher than the round it was locked in. This allows the validator to unlock if the rest of the network has precommitted something they don't want to, thus protecting liveness. However, you can unlock in a way that doesn't compromise safety by only allowing unlocking if there is a polka after the round the validator was locked. This means that the validator is locked at the previous height and Unlokc-on-polka cannot precommit at the new height until the validator sees a polka.

#### Unlock-on-Polka Scenarios 
To better understand why Unlock-on-Polka is needed, let's look at an example. 
- Validators: A, B, C, D
- Round R: Block B1 proposal
- Initial situation scenario:
   - a and b precommit B1. 
   - c and d precommit nil.
   - All validators move to the next round, and block B2, which was prevoted by c and d, is proposed. 

Progression scenario:
- A is a Byzantine node, and despite being locked on block B1, it also votes on block B2, causing a polka.
- B does not see the polka and precommits nil.
- A goes offline, while C and D precommit block B2. 

They move to the next round, but b is still locked on block B1, c and d are locked on block B2, and a is offline, so they can't get a polka. This causes liveness to be compromised even though there are less than 1/3 Byzantine validators (here, only a).

Resolution scenario: 
- If b verifies the polka for block B2 (which c and d used to justify precommitting to block B2), it should be able to unlock the lock on B1, so b should precommit to block B2.

This is the motivation for Unlock-on-Polka, which allows a validator to unlock and precommit a new block if it finds a polka in a round larger than the round it is currently locked in. 


## 3. The importance of two-stage voting and the lock mechanism
In the Tendermint consensus protocol, the two-stage voting and locking mechanisms are key to ensuring the safety and liveness of the network. A single vote is not enough to ensure safety in an asynchronous environment with Byzantine validators, so let's take a closer look at why two votes are necessary.

### The problem with single voting
The mechanism of having two rounds of voting, prevote and precommit, is an inheritance from PBFT. In a Byzantine environment, a single voting phase with each validator voting only once is not enough to ensure strong safety. A single voting mechanism can lead to the following problems
1. false information from Byzantine nodes: Byzantine nodes can propagate incorrect block information to the network, causing other validators to commit the wrong block.
2. Duplicate consensus due to asynchronous message delivery: Message delivery delays can cause some validators to commit a block while others start voting again on the same block.
> The problems with single voting are similar to the stochastic safety problems with PoW in Bitcoin or Gasper in Ethereum, where the first consensus is achieved. The only difference is that PoW is hypothetically concluded through The Longest Chain rule, and Ethereum has one more vote after some time has passed through the checkpoint concept introduced with PoS. Tendermint allows you to prevote, precommit, and guarantee safety (or instant finality) immediately through a large amount of communication at once. 

### Byzantine node misinformation scenario 
A Byzantine node may propagate false block information to the network, causing victim nodes to vote for the wrong block, resulting in the wrong block being committed.
1. Node 1 creates block B1 and proposes it to the entire network.
Node 1 and Node 2 vote on it and propagate it to the network. 
3. For some unknown reason, nodes 3 and 4 do not receive this message. 
4. Node 2, a Byzantine node, propagates false information to nodes 3 and 4 that block B2 is valid.
5. Node 3 and 4 trust node 2's information and vote for block B2.
> Tendermint continues to vote on the block (B1) that was locked in the previous round before proceeding to vote on the new block through the lock mechanism, and cannot easily vote on the new block (B2). This helps the network remain stable even when Byzantine nodes propagate misinformation.

### Redundant consensus scenarios due to asynchronous message delivery 
In an asynchronous network, message delivery delays can cause some validators to commit a block while others start voting again on the same block due to timeouts or other reasons.
1. Node 1 creates block B1 and proposes it to all the network.
2. Node 1 and 2 vote on it and propagate it to the network.
3. Due to message delivery delays, nodes 3 and 4 receive the message late, while nodes 1 and 2 commit block B1. 5.
4. Node 3 and 4 do not see the commit of block B1 and propose a new block B2.
> Tendermint's lock mechanism allows validators to continue voting on the currently locked block and continue consensus based on the previous locked block once the network resynchronizes. If a valid prevote does not occur for a set amount of time, validators do not commit to the block and move on to the next round.

## Next: Tendermint /w PoS 
Tendermint is a BFT-based consensus algorithm that achieves stable and reliable consensus in a variety of blockchain environments. This allows it to be effectively utilized on both public and private blockchains, and it plays a particularly important role in ecosystems like Cosmos. In the following, we'll learn about [the PoS mechanism that works with Tendermint](./99c2_tendermint_with_pos.md), which is used by the Cosmos Hub, the first hub of the Cosmos network.
