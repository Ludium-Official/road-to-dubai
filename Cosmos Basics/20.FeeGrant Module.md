# FeeGrant Module

## 0. `feegrant` module
One of the reasons why web3 is not accessible is the payment of fees: if you don't pay, it's hard to get even a vote. The [`feegrant` module](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.47.0/x/feegrant) was proposed in [ADR 029](https://docs.cosmos.network/maiarchitecture/adr-029-fee-grant-module) to address this inconvenience. The `feegrant` module allows a grantor (user, contract, or module) to pay a fee to broadcast a grantee's transaction to the blockchain, while the grantor retains full control over the token and can revoke the grant at any time. 

While `authz`, which we'll discuss later, is a module that allows you to sign and execute transactions on behalf of others, `feegrant` allows you to get permission to a token and use someone else's token on their behalf. A frequently discussed use case for the `feegrant` module is that it improves the onboarding experience for new users, as they don't have to earn tokens before they can start interacting with the blockchain or smart contracts. Two types of `FeeAllowance` are implemented in the feegrant module:
- [`BasicAllowance`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/proto/cosmos/feegrant/v1beta1/feegrant.proto#L14-L27): The grantee spends the fee from the grantor's account. This may be a one-time limit, expiring, or unlimited.
- [`PeriodicAllowance`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/proto/cosmos/feegrant/v1beta1/feegrant.proto#L29-L54): The grantee spends fees from the grantor's account. This has a periodic limit reset.

## 1. Status
1. [FeeAllowance](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/proto/cosmos/feegrant/v1beta1/feegrant.proto): Identified by a combination of grantee (the account address of the fee allowance recipient) and grantor (the account address of the fee allowance grantor).
2. [FeeAllowanceQueue](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.0/x/feegrant/migrations/v046/keys.go): This queue was added in `v0.46.0` and later. It checks the status of the queue for expired `FeeAllowances` in the [`Endblocker`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/x/feegrant/module/abci.go) and removes them if they have expired. 

## 2. Get status
### 1. Get a grant 
The grant command can be used to query grant information for a given grantor-grantee pair. 
```sh
simd query feegrant grant [granter] [grantee] [flags]
```

### 2. Get all grants 
#### Query
With `grants`, you can query all grant information for a given grantee.
```sh
simd query feegrant grants [grantee] [flags]
```

## 3. State Transformations 
### 1. grant 
The `grant` command allows a user to grant a fee allowance to another account. This can be set for an expiration date (`--period`), a total spend limit (`--spend-limit`), and/or a periodic spend limit (`--period-limit`). 
```sh
simd tx feegrant grant [granter] [grantee] [flags]
```

The transaction commands, including the total spend limit, are as follows:
```sh
simd tx feegrant grant cosmos1.. cosmos1.. --spend-limit 100stake
```

The transaction commands, including recurring spend limits, are as follows:
```sh
simd tx feegrant grant cosmos1.. cosmos1.. --period 3600 --period-limit 10stake
```

### 2. revoke
The `revoke` command allows a user to revoke a (fee allowance) that has already been granted.
```sh
simd tx feegrant revoke [granter] [grantee] [flags]
```


## 4. Practice 
In this practice, you will set up a base token called `stake` to be used as a fee on the blockchain and another token called `kudos` to be sent to friends.
- This time, Alice will be the validator and Bob will be the grantee of a Baisc award that allows Bob to send Alice a `kudos` token even if he has no stake tokens to pay as fees.
- Alice is the (granter) who pays Bob the base allowance.

### 1. Running simd 
> If you have used `simd` before, you may already have a `.simapp` directory in your home directory. If you want to keep the old data, you must save the directory to a different location or use the `--home` flag to specify a different directory for each command. If you do not want to keep the old data, remove the old directory (`rm -rf ~/.simapp`).

Clone the cosmos-sdk repository and change the version to `v0.45.4`:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
$ cd cosmos-sdk && git checkout v0.45.4
```

`simd` Build the binary:
```sh
$ make install
```

Once the build is complete, verify with a version check that `simd` is working properly: 
```sh
$ simd version

0.45.4 # good!
```

#### Setting up a chain
Sets the chain ID:
```sh
$ simd config chain-id feegrant-demo 
```

Set the keyring-backend name:
```sh
$ simd config keyring-backend test 
```

#### Setting up the key
Create Alice as the validator and Bob as the grantee:
```sh
$ simd keys add alice && simd keys add bob
```

Verify that the two keys were created successfully:
```sh
$ simd keys list
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
- name: alice
  type: local
  address: cosmos1p66k9e7r0l9ws2utqccm8pa5f2gh2dadr4ax7a
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AqgWlJJn74PZB14uYmCqafvEhBiC3LyJssb5VnmdeWxQ"}'
  mnemonic: ""
- name: bob
  type: local
  address: cosmos1d73pz3m25guayfx7m80g0npsrkw59aec6cl786
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A0qzyyKdJ8jPfJ0BIbaXbaFvsQExYjfx8x2b36RvftcI"}'
  mnemonic: ""
```

#### Getting started with Chain
Add the remaining default settings:
```sh
$ simd init test --chain-id feegrant-demo  &&
simd add-genesis-account alice 5000000000stake --keyring-backend test &&
simd add-genesis-account bob 2000kudos --keyring-backend test &&
simd gentx alice 1000000stake --chain-id feegrant-demo &&
simd collect-gentxs
```

Now start the chain:
```sh
$ simd start
```

To avoid copying and pasting user addresses when entering queries or transactional commands, it's a good idea to preset the user key as an accessible variable in the shell. 
```sh
$ export ALICE=$(simd keys show alice --address) && export BOB=$(simd keys show bob --address)
```

### 2. Granting allowance authorization
Before Bob can send `kudis` to Alice, we need to grant Bob an allowance so that Alice can pay the gas fee that the transaction might incur.

#### Authorize feegrant
The `BasicAllowance` is an authorization that allows the recipient to spend fees until the spend limit (`spend_limit`) or expiration (`expiration`) is reached. Give an allowance with a spend limit of `100000stake` and no expiration date.
```sh
$ simd tx feegrant grant $ALICE $BOB --spend-limit 100000stake
```

#### Checking allowance
```sh
$ simd query feegrant grants $BOB
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
allowances:
- allowance:
    '@type': /cosmos.feegrant.v1beta1.BasicAllowance
    expiration: null
    spend_limit:
    - amount: "100000"
      denom: stake
  grantee: cosmos1d73pz3m25guayfx7m80g0npsrkw59aec6cl786
  granter: cosmos1p66k9e7r0l9ws2utqccm8pa5f2gh2dadr4ax7a
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
- You can see that the granter is $ALICE and the grantee address is $BOB.

### 3. Transferring tokens (fee proxy)
#### balance inquiry
First, check Alice and Bob's balance. Checking the initial balance provides a baseline for later checking if the transaction was successful:
```sh
$ simd query bank balances $ALICE
```
```sh
balances:
- amount: "4999000000"
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

```sh
$ simd query bank balances $BOB
```
```sh
balances:
- amount: "2000"
  denom: kudos
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

#### Sending tokens
Any transaction sent using the tx command can use the `--fee-account` flag to specify the account to pay the fee as input. Bob sends Alice a `kudos` token and Alice pays the fee, as shown below:
```sh
$ simd tx bank send $BOB $ALICE 100kudos --from bob --fee-account $ALICE --fees 500stake
```

#### Retrieve balance again
```sh
$ simd query bank balances $ALICE
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
balances:
- amount: "100"
  denom: kudos
- amount: "4998999500"
  denom: stake
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```

Notice that Alice's `500stake` has been reduced by the transaction signed by Bob. Instead, the `100kudos` sent by Bob was added. 

```sh
$ simd query bank balances $BOB
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
balances:
- amount: "1900"
  denom: kudos
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
Bob sent it to Alice, so the `100kudos` is reduced.

#### Look up an allowance
```sh
$ simd query feegrant grants $BOB
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
allowances:
- allowance:
    '@type': /cosmos.feegrant.v1beta1.BasicAllowance
    expiration: null
    spend_limit:
    - amount: "99500"
      denom: stake
  grantee: cosmos19wugtkh265h7uzqqnh0qj2k02dwszvkdk5p8q6
  granter: cosmos10vd27ql8uu0ut0jumnyyylunlzqd7f3zxelhlt
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
The allowance amount has been reduced by `500stake`. 


### 4. Revoking allowance permissions 
A granter can revoke an allowance given to a grantee using the `revoke` command.

#### Canceling an allowance
```sh
$ simd tx feegrant revoke $ALICE $BOB --from alice
```

#### Look up an allowance
Let's check Bob's allowance:
```sh
$ simd query feegrant grants $BOB
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
allowances: []
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "0"
```
You can see that the allowances list is empty.
