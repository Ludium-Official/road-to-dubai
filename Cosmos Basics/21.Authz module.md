# Authz module

## 0. `authz` module
The [`authz` module](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/tree/v0.45.4/x/authz) provides the ability to authorize another account to perform actions on behalf of one account. This design is defined in [ADR 030](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/architecture/adr-030-authz-module). Cosmos SDK app developers implement the `authz` module to provide users with the ability to grant specific permissions to other users. For example, a user may want another user to vote on their behalf, so instead of granting the other user access to their account, they can grant the other user permission to run MsgVote on their behalf. Examples of usage include 
- A validator might want to create a separate account for voting to keep their validator keys more secure. 
- This can be used when you want to authorize individual accounts in a DAO to run messages without signatures from other members.


## 1. Status. 
1. [Grant](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.45.4/proto/cosmos/authz/v1beta1/authz.proto#L13-L39): Contains information about the authorization, including the granter, grantee, and authorization type. 
2. [GrantQueue](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.0/x/authz/authz.pb.go#L157-L161): This queue was added in `v0.46.0` and later. Whenever a `Grant` is created, it is added to the `GrantQueue`. In [`BeginBlocker`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.46.0/x/authz/module/abci.go), generate a prefix key with the current block time past the expiration date stored in the `GrantQueue` to continuously check for expired `Grant`, iterate over all matching records in the `GrantQueue`, and delete them from the `GrantQueue` and the storage of the `Grant`.

## 2. Get status
### 1. Get grants 
The `grants` command allows you to query grants for a grantor-grantee pair. If the message TypeURL is set, only grants for that message type are queried.
```sh
simd query authz grants [granter-addr] [grantee-addr] [msg-type-url]? [flags]
```


## 3. State transformation
### 1. exec
The `exec` command allows the grantor to execute a transaction on behalf of the grantee.
```sh
simd tx authz exec [tx-json-file] --from [grantee] [flags]
```

### 2. grant
The `grant` command allows the grantor to grant permissions to the specified person (grantee).
```sh
simd tx authz grant <grantee> <authorization_type="send"|"generic"|"delegate"|"unbond"|"redelegate"> --from <granter> [flags]
```

### 3. revoke
The `revoke` command allows a grantor to revoke a grantee's permissions.
```sh
simd tx authz revoke [grantee] [msg-type-url] --from =[granter] [flags]
```


## 4. Practice 
In this practice, you will use `simapp` in the Cosmos SDK to run a single-node network, authorize another account, and then execute messages as a grantee on behalf of the authorizer.

### 1. Run simd 
> If you have used `simd` before, you may already have a `.simapp` directory in your home directory. If you want to keep the old data, you must save the directory to a different location or specify a different directory for each command using the `--home` flag. If you do not want to keep the old data, remove the old directory (`rm -rf ~/.simapp`).

Clone the cosmos-sdk repository and change the version to `v0.45.4`:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk
$ cd cosmos-sdk && git checkout v0.45.4
```

`simd` Build the binary:
```sh
$ make install
```

Once the build is complete, verify with a version check that `simd` is working properly: 
```sh
$ simd version

0.45.4 # good!
```

#### Setting up a chain
Sets the chain ID:
```sh
$ simd config chain-id authz-demo 
```

Set the keyring-backend name:
```sh
$ simd config keyring-backend test 
```

#### Set up the key 
Create Alice and Bob to act as the granter and grantee:
```sh
$ simd keys add alice 
$ simd keys add bob 
```

Verify that the two keys were created successfully:
```sh
$ simd keys list
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
- name: alice
  type: local
  address: cosmos123g9hxppa4e50tn25khja3zpeqz49augrznpes
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AvcJre0Gy06nAhyVq3CBWRp4wXZMKVGIhcTTf3IdIIkW"}'
  mnemonic: ""
- name: bob
  type: local
  address: cosmos1ql029f9wez4lw7jr87j05hpjm5c9nqt2y7vrs5
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AktnhrU99tgVmR3xUspWaicbA2TTngCDHlK6JhUCNglQ"}'
  mnemonic: ""
```

#### Setting up a Chain
The following command sets up a chain using `simapp`.

Set the chain ID:
```sh
$ simd config chain-id authz-demo
```

Set up a keyring backend:
```sh
$ simd config keyring-backend test
```

Initialize the node:
```sh
$ simd init test --chain-id authz-demo
```

Add Alice and her initial balance to the genesis file:
```sh
$ simd add-genesis-account alice 5000000000stake --keyring-backend test
```

Add Bob and the initial balance to the genesis file:
```sh
$ simd add-genesis-account bob 5000000000stake --keyring-backend test
```

Create a transaction to add Alice to the initial validator set:
```sh
$ simd gentx alice 1000000stake --chain-id authz-demo
```

Add the validator transaction to the genesis file:
```sh
$ simd collect-gentxs
```

Now start the chain:
```sh
$ simd start
```

To avoid copying and pasting user addresses when entering queries or transactional commands, it's a good idea to preset the user key as an accessible variable in the shell. 
```sh
$ export ALICE=$(simd keys show alice --address)
$ export BOB=$(simd keys show bob --address)
```

### 2. Submitting a proposal 
To prove your right to vote on a governance proposal, you must first create a governance proposal. The following command creates a text proposal with a minimum deposit so that the governance proposal can immediately enter the voting period.
 > For more information about the command and flag options, run `simd tx gov submit-proposal --help`

#### Create a proposal
```sh
$ simd tx gov submit-proposal --title="Test Authorization" --description="Is Bob authorized to vote?" --type="Text" --deposit="10000000stake" --from alice
```

####  Look up a proposal
```sh
$ simd query gov proposal 1
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh 
content:
  '@type': /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.TextProposal
  description: Is Bob authorized to vote?
  title: Test Authorization
deposit_end_time: "2024-07-04T08:19:50.144423Z"
final_tally_result:
  abstain: "0"
  "no": "0"
  no_with_veto: "0"
  "yes": "0"
proposal_id: "1"
status: PROPOSAL_STATUS_VOTING_PERIOD
submit_time: "2024-07-02T08:19:50.144423Z"
total_deposit:
- amount: "10000000"
  denom: stake
voting_end_time: "2024-07-04T08:19:50.144423Z"
voting_start_time: "2024-07-02T08:19:50.144423Z"
```

### 3. Granting a Grant
Next, the granter must grant authorization to the grantee. 
- The authorization type here is “generic”, which takes a message type like MsgVote as a parameter and gives the grantee unrestricted permission to execute that message on behalf of the granter. 
- Other authorization types include “send”, “delegate”, “unbond”, and “redelegate”, in which case the granter can set a limit on the number of tokens. 
- Of course, the granter can revoke previously granted permissions. Until then, the grantee can use the authorization at will. 

#### Creating an authorization
```sh
$ simd tx authz grant $BOB generic --msg-type /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote --from alice
```


#### querying authorization
Use the following query to get the list of authorizations that Alice gave to Bob:
```sh
$ simd query authz grants $ALICE $BOB /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
grants:
- authorization:
    '@type': /cosmos.authz.v1beta1.GenericAuthorization
    msg: /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote
  expiration: "2025-07-02T08:06:24Z"
pagination: null
```

From now on, **granter = Alice, grantee = Bob**.

### 4. Creating a Transaction
In order for Bob to execute the message on Alice's behalf, Alice must first create an unsigned transaction.

#### create unsigned transaction
Create a transaction in which Alice agrees to the gov proposal. 
```sh
$ simd tx gov vote 1 yes --from $ALICE --generate-only > tx.json
```

#### lookup transaction
```sh
$ cat tx.json
```
:
The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```json
{
    "body": {
        "messages": [
            {
                "@type": "/cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote",
                "proposal_id": "1",
                "voter": "cosmos1jxd2uhx0j6e59306jq3jfqs7rhs7cnhvey4lqh",
                "option": "VOTE_OPTION_YES"
            }
        ],
        "memo": "",
        "timeout_height": "0",
        "extension_options": [],
        "non_critical_extension_options": []
    },
    "auth_info": {
        "signer_infos": [],
        "fee": {
            "amount": [],
            "gas_limit": "200000",
            "payer": "",
            "granter": ""
        }
    },
    "signatures": []
}
```


### 5. Execute Instead of Transaction 
Bob can use the transaction `execute` command to sign and send a transaction that Alice has already created. The author (`--from` address) of the transaction must be set to Bob (grantee). 

#### Signing and executing a transaction 
```sh
$ simd tx authz exec tx.json --from bob
```
```json
{
    "body": {
        "messages": [
            {
                "@type": "/cosmos.authz.v1beta1.MsgExec",
                "grantee": "cosmos1khljzagdncfs03x5g6rf9qp5p93z9qgc3w5dwt",
                "msgs": [
                    {
                        "@type": "/cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote",
                        "proposal_id": "1",
                        "voter": "cosmos1jxd2uhx0j6e59306jq3jfqs7rhs7cnhvey4lqh",
                        "option": "VOTE_OPTION_YES"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ],
        "memo": "",
        "timeout_height": "0",
        "extension_options": [],
        "non_critical_extension_options": []
    },
    "auth_info": {
        "signer_infos": [],
        "fee": {
            "amount": [],
            "gas_limit": "200000",
            "payer": "",
            "granter": ""
        }
    },
    "signatures": []
}
```

#### Look up vote
```sh
$ simd query gov vote 1 $ALICE
```

The result of the lookup looks like the following sample:
```sh
option: VOTE_OPTION_YES
options:
- option: VOTE_OPTION_YES
  weight: "1.000000000000000000"
proposal_id: "1"
voter: cosmos1jxd2uhx0j6e59306jq3jfqs7rhs7cnhvey4lqh
```

### 6. Revoking an authorization 
Alice (the granter) can revoke an authorization that she has already granted to Bob (the grantee) 

#### revoke authorization 
```sh
$ simd tx authz revoke $BOB /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote --from alice
```

#### Look up authorization
```sh
$ simd query authz grants $ALICE $BOB /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote
```

The authorization is successfully revoked if you receive an unretrievable error, such as the following:
```sh
Error: rpc error: code = NotFound desc = rpc error: code = NotFound desc = no authorization found for /cosmos.gov.v1beta1.MsgVote type: key not found
```
