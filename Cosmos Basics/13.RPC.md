# RPC
> Before we dive into the gRPC, REST, and CometBFT used by the cosmos-sdk and cometbft, it is important to learn about the technology behind them. 


## 0. IPC(Inter-Process Communication)
When you peel back the layers of a blockchain node, it's just a process running on top of an OS. Therefore, blockchain can be described as a replicated state machine, where multiple processes communicate with each other to make consensual state transitions and continuously synchronize their states. Here, “inter-process communication” refers to a mechanism for sending and receiving data or synchronizing between different processes, called IPC (Inter-Process Communication). This is a fundamental part of covering the Cosmos SDK, which is designed to make it easy to communicate and interoperate with other nodes. IPC enables efficient interaction between processes in a variety of situations, and is especially useful in situations where resource constraints or excessive computation is required. It is also key to distributed systems, where multiple processes work together to achieve a single goal. Two common IPC methods are shared memory and message passing.

### Shared Memory
Memory that is set up to be shared between processes and is accessible to all processes. This allows for efficient data access, but the downside is that multiple processes can access shared memory at the same time, which can lead to synchronization issues that compromise memory safety. 

### Message passing 
This refers to a method of communicating directly with each other to deliver the data they need without having a shared data store. This eliminates the need to worry about synchronization caused by concurrency. However, frequent communication or large amounts of data can lead to a lack of resources and performance degradation. 

## 1. IPC in Client-Server Systems
IPC technology can also be used for client-server communication. It is a message passing method with Socket at the lowest level and RPC and HTTP communication techniques as abstractions on top of it.

### 1-1. Socket 
A socket is an endpoint for external communication. When a pair of processes communicate on a network, each process uses a pair of sockets. Sockets are identified by a port number and IP address, and typically use a client-server architecture. 
- Server: Listens for incoming client requests on the specified port.
- Client: Requests a connection to the server, and the process's OS assigns a random port to attempt to connect. 

Communication over sockets is common and efficient, but it is a low-level form of IPC. It can be thought of as a means to utilize TCP or UDP at the transport layer (L4) of the OSI model. Sockets become more complex to handle as communication increases because the data exchanged between communication threads is in the form of unstructured bytestreams.


### 1-2. HTTP API
HTTP APIs use the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to facilitate request-response communication between a client and a server. This globally standardized protocol is readily available on a variety of platforms and languages and integrates well with web technologies. The HTTP API operates at the application layer (L7) of the OSI model and utilizes the basic transport mechanism provided by sockets at the transport layer (L4). This abstraction makes sending and receiving data easier compared to socket programming. 

#### HTTP Method 
The HTTP API represents resources as URLs and uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources. Here's an example of a simple HTTP GET request.

```http
GET /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
```
The server can send a JSON-formatted response like this.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

#### REST(Representational State Transfer)
REST is an architectural style for distributed systems introduced by Roy T. Fielding in his paper ['Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures'](https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm). While many APIs claim to be RESTful, they often don't strictly follow the REST architecture style. Actually, it's more accurate to say they don't. It's too expensive to design an API to meet HATEOS-like requirements. However, what we all want to do is use the right HTTP methods and design resources explicitly. For more information on designing REST APIs, see the following:
- [Day1, 2-2. Is such a REST API good enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RP_f5dMoHFc&ab_channel=NAVERD2)
- [Microsoft REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/api-guidelines/blob/master/Guidelines.md) 


### 1-3. RPC(Remote Procedure Call)
Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) allow you to run a function or procedure in a different address space without the need for remote control coding. In other words, RPCs allow programmers to use the same code regardless of whether the function is local or remote. Like the HTTP API, RPC operates at the application layer (L7) and uses the underlying socket mechanism at the transport layer (L4) to handle the details of communication. This abstraction reduces the complexity of transport layer protocols, allowing developers to use application-level code to make function calls for communication.
- The details of client-server communication are hidden as much as possible.
- The client and server can call procedures on the remote side as if they were calling regular methods.


## 2. Interface Definition Language (IDL)
The HTTP API and RPCs operate at the application layer, where programs are built using languages like C++, Java, Go, and Rust. To ensure that these programs are not constrained by a specific programming language, an Interface Definition Language (IDL) is defined so that they can exchange messages using their own data format rather than the low-level socket message format.

### 2-1. JSON
JSON is a common IDL format used for both HTTP APIs and RPC communication. Being a human-friendly language, it is very maintainable and accessible. This is why Ethereum uses [JSON-RPC](https://ethereum.org/ko/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc/):
- Conciseness and readability: JSON is a text-based format that is easy to read and write, which is beneficial for debugging and logging.
- Web-friendly: JSON is highly compatible with web technologies, making it easy to integrate with dapps.
- Versatility: JSON can be easily parsed and generated by a variety of programming languages, making it highly interoperable with Ethereum clients.

However, JSON is not size-efficient relative to its data content. This is a disadvantage of the IPC message passing method mentioned above, and sending and receiving large amounts of data can cause delays or waiting due to lack of resources. 

### 2-2. Protobuf (Protocol Buffer)
In 2016, [Protobuf](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%94%84%EB%A1%9C%ED%86%A0%EC%BD%9C_%EB%B2%84%ED%8D%BC), which is used by the gRPC framework created by Google, was released as open source. It efficiently handles serialization and deserialization of data, making it suitable for handling large amounts of data.

#### Protobuf encoding and decoding
Let's say you have data represented in JSON as follows.
 ```json
{ 
	"userName": "Martin", 
	"favouriteNumber": 1337, 
	"interests": ["daydreaming", "hacking"] 
}
```

To use Protobuf, you define a data structure called `message` using a simple, human-readable schema language. The key is to reduce data in JSON by replacing data attribute values that act as keys in the data with field_tags. Data attribute values that act as keys in a key-value structure, such as 'userName', 'favoriteNumber', 'interests', can be represented as 1-byte meta-information by combining the attribute value and type. 
- [More on Protobuf encoding](https://medium.com/naver-cloud-platform/nbp-%EA%B8%B0%EC%88%A0-%EA%B2%BD%ED%97%98-%EC%8B%9C%EB%8C%80%EC%9D%98-%ED%9D%90%EB%A6%84-grpc-%EA%B9%8A%EA%B2%8C-%ED%8C%8C%EA%B3%A0%EB%93%A4%EA%B8%B0-2-b01d390a7190)

```protobuf
message Person { 
	required string user_name = 1; 
	optional int64 favourite_number = 2; 
	repeated string interests = 3; 
}
```

It is also used by the Cosmos-SDK with its interchain functionality:
- Performance: good compression, so it can handle data in a smaller size compared to other IDLs (XML, JSON...). 
- Flexibility: [supports many languages](https://protobuf.dev/overview/#cross-lang) to increase interoperability between interchains written in different languages.

However, it has the disadvantage of being difficult to debug because the data is encoded and represented as binary data before being decoded when packet transmission errors or delays occur on the network.

## 3. gRPC
gRPC is a high-performance RPC framework developed by Google that uses Protobuf for serialization. It supports multiple environments and languages to enable seamless communication between client and server.
- Server: Implements an interface and runs a gRPC server to handle client calls.
- Client: The client has a stub (client) that provides the same methods as the server.

### 3-1. gRPC Messages and Services
In gRPC, communication between client and server is defined using Protobufs. A gRPC service specifies the methods that can be called remotely, along with the input/output message types.

#### Example 
The following is an example of a simple gRPC service definition:
```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package example;

service Greeter {
  // A simple RPC.
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}

// The request message containing the user's name.
message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

// The response message containing the greeting.
message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```
- `Greeter` is a service that defines the RPC `SayHello`.
- A `HelloRequest` is a message containing a username.
- A `HelloReply` is a message containing a greeting message.

A client application can call `SayHello` from the `Greeter` service to deliver a `HelloRequest` message and receive a `HelloReply` message in return.

### 3-2. gRPC Communication
- Server: Implements the Greeter service and runs a gRPC server to handle client calls.
- Client: Use the stub to call the SayHello method as if it were a local method on the server.

### 3-3. gRPC Gateway.
[gRPC-Gateway](https://github.com/grpc-ecosystem/grpc-gateway) is a plugin for the Protobuf compiler protc that creates a reverse proxy server, converting RESTful HTTP API calls to gRPC. It reads Protobuf service definitions and creates a server based on the `google.api.http` annotation, allowing you to serve gRPC and RESTful APIs simultaneously.
