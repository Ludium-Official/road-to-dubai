# Stores and keepers
> Since Tendermint [migrated to CometBFT](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/14870) from cosmos-sdk v0.47, the article is based on cosmos-sdk v0.47, cometbft v0.38. 

## 0. Store
The Cosmos SDK provides a Store feature to maintain the state of your app. The following shows the most basic [`Store`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/types/store.go#L15-L18) interface.
```go
type Store interface {
	GetStoreType() StoreType
	CacheWrapper
}
```
- `GetStoreType()` is a Get method that returns the StoreType.
- [`CacheWrapper`]((https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/types/store.go#L263-L287)) is a simple interface that implements Store read caching and write branching via the `Write()` method.

 ### 1. Store Read Caching & Write Branching
Read caching and write branching are universally used in the Cosmos SDK and should be implemented in every `StoreType`. Branching creates an isolated, temporary branch of the `Store` that can be passed to and updated without affecting the main `Store`. This is used to make temporary state transitions to make it easier to roll back later if an error occurs. 

The following is the [CacheMultiStore()](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/rootmulti/store.go#L477-L491) method that creates the caching store implemented by `rootmulti.Store`:
```go
func (rs *Store) CacheMultiStore() types.CacheMultiStore {
	stores := make(map[types.StoreKey]types.CacheWrapper)
	for k, v := range rs.stores {
		store := types.KVStore(v)
		// Wire the listenkv.Store to allow listeners to observe the writes from the cache store,
		// set same listeners on cache store will observe duplicated writes.
		if rs.ListeningEnabled(k) {
			store = listenkv.NewStore(store, k, rs.listeners[k])
		}
		stores[k] = store
	}
	return cachemulti.NewStore(rs.db, stores, rs.keysByName, rs.traceWriter, rs.getTracingContext())
}
```

Here is the [Write() method](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/cachemulti/store.go#L122-L128) implemented by `cachemulti.Store`:
```go
// Write calls Write on each underlying store.
func (cms Store) Write() {
	cms.db.Write()
	for _, store := range cms.stores {
		store.Write()
	}
}
```

### 2. Commit Store
[`CommitStore`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/types/store.go#L29-L33) represents a store that can commit changes to the base tree or DB. The Cosmos SDK distinguishes between simple stores and commit stores by extending the basic `Store` interface with `Committer`. 
```go
// Stores of MultiStore must implement CommitStore.
type CommitStore interface {
	Committer
	Store
}
```

[`Committer`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/types/store.go#L20-L27) is an interface that defines methods to persist changes to disk.
```go
// something that can persist to disk
type Committer interface {
	Commit() CommitID 
	LastCommitID() CommitID

	SetPruning(pruningtypes.PruningOptions)
	GetPruning() pruningtypes.PruningOptions
}
```
- The `CommitID` is the deterministic commit of the state tree. The corresponding hash value is returned to a consensus engine like CometBFT and stored in the block header. 


The `CommitStore` interface exists for a number of purposes, one of which is to ensure that no object can commit to the store arbitrarily. As part of the Cosmos SDK's object-capabilities model, only `baseapp` should be able to commit to the store. This is why the [`ctx.KVStore()`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/types/context.go#L281) method that modules normally use to access the `Store` returns a non-committable `KVStore` rather than a `CommitKVStore`.


## 1. KVStore
### 1. IAVL Store 
The default implementation of `KVStore` and `CommitKVStore` used by `baseapp` is [`iavl.Store`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/store/iavl/store.go#L37-L41).
```go
type Store struct {
	tree   Tree
	logger log.Logger
}
```

The iavl store is based on the IAVL Tree, a self-balancing binary tree that guarantees that:
- The `Get` and `Set` operations are `O(log n)`, where n is the number of elements in the tree.
- Iteration efficiently returns elements sorted within a range.
- Each version of the tree is immutable and can be retrieved even after commit (depending on the pruning setting).


### 2. KVStore
The [`KVStore`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/types/store.go#L206-L242) is a simple key-value store used to store and retrieve data. The `KVStore` interface is primarily used to restrict modules from accessing the `Committer`. Each module in an app has its own `KVStore`, which can only be accessed through a specific `key` held by the module's `Keeper`. These `KVStores` are used to manage a subset of the global state. 
```go
type BasicKVStore interface {
	Get(key []byte) []byte
	Has(key []byte) bool
	Set(key, value []byte)
	Delete(key []byte)
}

type KVStore interface {
	Store
	BasicKVStore
	Iterator(start, end []byte) Iterator
	ReverseIterator(start, end []byte) Iterator
}
```
- `KVStore` implements basic methods such as the `Get` and `Set` methods through the `BasicKVStore` interface.
- The `Iterator(start, end)` method, which returns an `Iterator` object, is typically used to iterate over a range of keys that share a common prefix. 
    - Example: [IterateAccountBalances() method](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/x/bank/keeper/view.go#L115-L132) in module keeper of `bank` that iterates over an accountStore to retrieve the balance of a specific account.


### 3. CommitKVStore
[`CommitKVStore`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/types/store.go#L257-L261) is a `KVStore` that also implements a `Committer`. 
```go
// CommitKVStore is an interface for MultiStore.
type CommitKVStore interface {
	Committer
	KVStore
}
```

[The mounted store is `CommitKVStore`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/rootmulti/store.go#L64) in the default `CommitKVStore` of `baseapp` that allows commit functionality. The key list (`keys`) of the `KVStore` is declared as a proxy and mounted in the `MultiStore` when the app is run. It also passes its key list (`keys`) to the module `keeper` that manages each store. 

## 2. KVStore Wrapper
### 1. CacheKVStore
[`cachekv.Store`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/cachekv/store.go#L26-L35) is a `KVStore Wrapper` that provides buffered writes/cached reads to the underlying `KVStore`. This wrapper is typically used whenever a temporary, rollbackable store is needed.
```go
type Store struct {
	mtx           sync.Mutex
	cache         map[string]*cValue
	unsortedCache map[string]struct{}
	sortedCache   internal.BTree // always ascending sorted
	parent        types.KVStore
}
```
#### Get Methods
[`Store.Get()`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/cachekv/store.go#L52-L68) first checks if there is a value associated with the key in `Store.cache`. 
- If a value exists, the function returns the value. 
- Otherwise, the function calls `Store.parent.Get()`, caches the result in `Store.cache`, and returns it.

#### Set method
[`Store.Set()`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/cachekv/store.go#L70-L79) sets the key-value pair to `Store.cache`. 
- The [`cValue`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/cachekv/store.go#L21-L24) has a bool field named `dirty` that indicates whether the cached value is different from the default value. 
- When `Store.Set()` caches the new pair, `cValue.dirty` is set to true so that it can be written to the underlying store when `Store.Write()` is called.

#### Iterator Methods
[`Store.Iterator()`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/cachekv/store.go#L159-L162) should iterate over both cached and original items. In [`Store.iterator()`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/cachekv/store.go#L169-L193), two iterators are created for each and merged. 

### 2. `GasKv` Store
Cosmos SDK apps use gas to track resource usage and prevent spam. The [`GasKv.Store`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/store/gaskv/store.go#L11-L17) is a `KVStore Wrapper` that can automatically consume gas whenever the store is read or written. It is the solution of choice for tracking storage usage in Cosmos SDK apps.


### 3. `TraceKv` Store
[`tracekv.Store`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/store/tracekv/store.go#L20-L43) is a `KVStore Wrapper` that provides operational tracing capabilities to the underlying `KVStore`. If tracing is enabled on the root `Multistore`, it is automatically applied by the Cosmos SDK to all `KVStores`.

### 4. `Prefix` Store
[`prefix.Store`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/store/prefix/store.go#L15-L21) is a `KVStore Wrapper` that provides automatic key prefixing functionality to the default `KVStore`.

### 5. `ListenKv` Store
[`listenkv.Store`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0-rc1/store/listenkv/store.go#L11-L18) is a `KVStore Wrapper` that provides the ability to receive state through the underlying KVStore. 
- It is automatically applied by the Cosmos SDK to any `KVStore` whose `StoreKey` is specified during state streaming configuration. 
- Additional information about configuring state streaming can be found in store/streaming/README.md.

## 3. Multistore
### 1. Multistore Interface
[`Multistore`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/types/store.go#L101-L133) is a kind of `KVStore` that follows the interface below: 
```go
type MultiStore interface {
	Store
	CacheMultiStore() CacheMultiStore
	CacheMultiStoreWithVersion(version int64) (CacheMultiStore, error)

	GetStore(StoreKey) Store
	GetKVStore(StoreKey) KVStore

	TracingEnabled() bool

	// ...
}
```
- `TracingEnabled() == true` When tracing is enabled, branching a `Multistore` wraps all the underlying `KVStores` into a `TraceKv.Store`.


Each Cosmos SDK app will have a store in the root that is an extension of the `Multistore` to maintain its state. 

### 2. CommitMultiStore
[`CommitMultiStore`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/types/store.go#L141-L203) is a store that extends `Committer` with the ability to commit from the `Multistore` interface. 
```go
type CommitMultiStore interface {
	Committer
	MultiStore
	snapshottypes.Snapshotter

	// ...
}
```

A concrete implementation of the `CommitMultiStore` interface can be found in [`rootMulti.Store`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/rootmulti/store.go). The `rootMulti.Store` is a base layer `Multistore` built around a `DB` on which multiple `KVStores` can be mounted, and is the default `Multistore` used by `baseapp`.


### 3. CacheMultistore
Whenever you branch from `rootMulti.Store`, [`cachemulti.Store`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/cachemulti/store.go) is used. Here, you can see that we are mainly using Store read caching and write branching. 
- `cachemulti.Store` branches all substores from the constructor (creating a virtual store for each substore) and stores them in [`Store.stores`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/cachemulti/store.go#L28), caching all read queries. 
- [`Store.GetKVStore()`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/cachemulti/store.go#L163-L170) returns the store from `Store.stores`. 
- [`Store.Write()`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/store/cachemulti/store.go#L122-L128) recursively calls `CacheWrap.Write()` on all sub-stores contained in `Store.stores`.

### 4. Store management in Cosmos SDK 
The `CommitMultiStore` used in `baseapp`, also known as the root `Store`, has the `MultiStore` and `Commiter` features of a KVStore. These features are integrated through the [`CommitKVStore`] (./13_store_and_keeper.md#commitkvstore) to manage data from multiple modules. Let's see how to create, mount, and use `CommitMultiStore-` via the [`NewSimapp constructor`](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/simapp/app.go#L214-L531) in `simapp`.

#### 1. Create a list of keys (`keys`)
The `KVStoreKey` is a key to identify the `CommitKVStore` that will store the data for each module. The function to generate it is as follows.
In the code below, the `KVStoreKey` objects are created using the `StoreKeys` of the various modules and stored in a map called `keys`:
```go
keys := sdk.NewKVStoreKeys(
    authtypes.StoreKey, banktypes.StoreKey, ...
)
```

#### 2. Initializing modules
When initializing the keeper for each module, the module's `StoreKey` is retrieved from the key list (`keys`) and initialized. For example, `BankKeeper` is initialized like this
```go
app.BankKeeper = bankkeeper.NewBaseKeeper(
		appCodec,
		keys[banktypes.StoreKey],
		app.AccountKeeper,
		BlockedAddresses(),
		authtypes.NewModuleAddress(govtypes.ModuleName).String(),
	)
```

#### 3. Mounting keys to the CommitMultiStore
Finally, to efficiently manage each state and allow different modules to store and access their data independently, we mount the list of keys (`keys`) created by `KVStoreKey` in `CommitMultiStore`. This allows each module to have its own `CommitKVStore`:
```go
app.cms.MountStoreWithDB(keys)

func (rs *Store) MountStoreWithDB(key types.StoreKey) {
	rs.storesParams[key] = newStoreParams(key, db, typ, 0)
	rs.keysByName[key.Name()] = key
}
```

## 4. Keeper
Cosmos SDK apps are typically organized into multiple modules. Each module handles specific domain logic, and the state of each module is managed by a `Keeper`.
- Overall app state: Managed through a `rootMulti.Store` that implements `CommitMultiStore`. This represents the overall state of the blockchain.
- Subset state: Each module handles state specific to its domain, which is accessed and managed through a `Keeper`.


The `Keeper` is literally a gatekeeper for the module's `Store`, an abstracted piece of code in the Cosmos SDK app that manages access to subset state. All access to a module's state data must go through that module's `Keeper`.
- Each `Store` (typically an `IAVL Store`) handled within a module is provided with a `storeKey` that grants access. 
- The module's `Keeper` defines the read and write methods for that module `Store` via this `storeKey`, which must remain unexposed to the outside world.

For example, in the case of BankKeeper, this would look like this
- [Send](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/x/bank/keeper/keeper.go#L38-L40): Provides the ability to send tokens to and from accounts and modules. 
- [GetBalance](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/x/bank/keeper/view.go#L21-L34): Retrieves the balance of a specific account. 


### 1. object-capabilities model 
The `Keeper` manages the state of `KVStore` and interacts with other modules in a structure similar to the [Repository pattern](https://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html), which is commonly used in object-oriented programming (OOP), because the Cosmos SDK adopts an [object-capabilities](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.0/docs/docs/core/10-ocap.md) based approach to help developers better protect their apps from unwanted interactions between modules. 

Object-capabilities have the advantage of ensuring modularity in code design and reliable encapsulation of code implementation. This can be analyzed at an abstracted level, where the code that determines the behavior of objects that update the app state is object-referenced and linked. As a result, these new modules can be easily debugged and well-maintained as they are added.
