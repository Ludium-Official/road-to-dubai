# Key components of AppChain

### Preview

**Hello Earth 🌏!, Welcome to Cosmos 🌌**, Welcome to the third chapter of the Cosmos Basics course.

The next topic we'll cover is the architecture of the Cosmos app chain. Let's skip the long-windedness and get right to it.

### Cosmos-SDK Based App Chain Architecture

Now it's finally time to explain the architecture of the Cosmos app chain.

The picture below was already shown at the end of the last session, so it should be a little more familiar to the students. 👀 👀 👀 👀 👍.


```sh
                ^  +-------------------------------+  ^
                |  |                               |  |   Built with Cosmos SDK
                |  |  State-machine = Application  |  |
                |  |                               |  v
                |  +-------------------------------+
                |  |                               |  ^
Blockchain node |  |           Consensus           |  |
                |  |                               |  |
                |  +-------------------------------+  |   CometBFT
                |  |                               |  |
                |  |           Networking          |  |
                |  |                               |  |
                v  +-------------------------------+  v
```
The first thing to point out is to reorganize the above structure as follows.

The reason why we generally call it an app chain is that the Consensus & Networking Level (=CometBFT or Tendermint Level) below can be developed by focusing on the application without worrying about the Consensus & Networking Level (=CometBFT or Tendermint Level) as much as possible from the developer's point of view.

This is exactly the nature of SDKs in general development. However, most of the Cosmos SDKs use CometBFT (=Tendermint) as a consensus as already mentioned above, so partly developers need to familiarize themselves with the concepts of DPoS and PBFT.

However, it's not necessary for us to develop AppChain right now, so let's skip it.

(If you're interested in learning more about this, you can check out this [link](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.37/introduction/what-is-cometbft) for a preview)

(+From now on, we'll refer to it as CometBFT instead of Tendermint)

```sh
              +---------------------+
              |                     |
              |     Application     |       -> Cosmos-SDK
              |                     |
              +--------+---+--------+
                       ^   |
                       |   | ABCI
                       |   v
              +--------+---+--------+
              |                     |
              |                     |
              |       CometBFT      |
              |                     |
              |                     |
              +---------------------+
```

### ABCI(Application Blockchain Interface)

Between last time and this time, we've learned a lot about the structure of appchains using the Cosmos-SDK.

If you are a keen developer, you may have noticed that the appchain level, which is the application level we will create, and the cometbft level, which is responsible for the actual consensus, are separated by an interface called ABCI.

Therefore, as I said last time, you don't necessarily need to build a CometBFT & Cosmos-SDK based application combination, and any combination is possible as long as you follow the paired interfaces.

However, due to the lack of multi-language clients like Ethereum, most chains are being developed using the CometBFT & Cosmos-SDK combination.

However, there is an interesting twist in ABCI. Recently, most of the chains that are gaining attention in the Cosmos Ecosystem are introducing ABCI++, an extension of ABCI that is more extended from the original ABCI called ABCI.

I will post this as an [assignment](./homework/03.md), so let's look it up and share it next time.

> The ABCI also allows developers to swap the consensus engine of their application-specific blockchain. Today, only CometBFT is production-ready, but in the future other consensus engines are expected to emerge.

Before we finish with ABCI, let's talk about what you need to know about it.

> Note that CometBFT only handles transaction bytes. It has no knowledge of what these bytes mean. All CometBFT does is order these transaction bytes deterministically. CometBFT passes the bytes to the application via the ABCI, and expects a return code to inform it if the messages contained in the transactions were successfully processed or not.

As you can see from the English text above, we can infer that each node client operates through the ABCI interface in this form.

In other words, the basic blockchain behavior is achieved through two layers of communication. (Note the arrows in the diagram below)

```sh
                   +---------------------+
                   |                     |
                   |     Application     |       -> Cosmos-SDK
                   |                     |
                   +--------+---+--------+
        (ABCI)              ^   |             (ABCI)
received transaction bytes->|   | <- return codes(success or not)
                            |   v
                   +--------+---+--------+
                   |                     |
                   |                     |
                   |       CometBFT      |
                   |                     |
                   |                     |
                   +---------------------+
```

And finally, the most important takeaway from ABCI is this: “The most important thing you need to know is this.
(but this is kind of like liberal arts stuff you don't need to know right away, just read it once and move on)

- CheckTx: When CometBFT receives a transaction, it is passed to the application to verify that it meets some basic requirements. CheckTx is used to protect the mempool of a pool node from spam transactions. A special handler called AnteHandler is used to run a series of validation steps, such as checking for sufficient fees and signature verification, and if the validation is valid, the transaction is added to the mempool and relayed to the peer nodes. In CheckTx, the state is not modified because the transaction was not included in the block.

- DeliverTx: When CometBFT receives a valid block, each transaction in the block is passed to the application via DeliverTx for processing. A state transition occurs at this stage, where the AnteHandler is executed again, as well as the actual Msg service RPCs for each message in the transaction.

- BeginBlock/EndBlock: These messages are executed at the beginning and end of each block, whether the block contains a transaction or not. They are useful for automatically executing logic. However, they should be used with caution as computationally expensive loops can slow down the blockchain or even halt the blockchain if the loop is infinite.

A more detailed description of ABCI methods can be found in the CometBFT documentation, but suffice it to say that the interface methods are organized through the CheckTx and DeliverTx implemented in ABCI.

**As a developer, you might think that you always need to implement these interfaces in your appchain application level (app.go). Fortunately, you don't need to implement the ABCI interfaces yourself, but** you can extend the baseapp provided by the Cosmos SDK and use it as a structure for your appchain.

### Main Components of Cosmos SDK

Now let's take a look at the components of the Cosmos SDK.

There are three main components of Cosmos-SDK.

1. baseapp
2. multistore
3. modules

We won't go into all of them in depth in this article, but we'll just cover the parts that are related to the above.

First of all, we have already learned the architecture of an app chain application using Cosmos-SDK, which is divided into application level and cometbft level, so let's see how transactions are handled in that architecture.


```sh
                   +---------------------+
                   |                     |
                   |     Application     |       -> Cosmos-SDK
                   |                     |
                   +--------+---+--------+
        (ABCI)              ^   |             (ABCI)
received transaction bytes->|   | <- return codes(success or not)
                            |   v
                   +--------+---+--------+
                   |                     |
                   |                     |
                   |       CometBFT      |
                   |                     |
                   |                     |
                   +---------------------+
```
In an application built on top of the Cosmos SDK, transactions sent to DeliverTx via CometBFT are processed as follows

1. decode the `transactions` received from the CometBFT consensus engine (CometBFT only deals with `[]bytes`).
2. extract `messages` from `transactions` and perform basic integrity checks.
3. route each `messages` to the appropriate module to process.
4. commit the state change.

Now let's take a look at the main components one by one!

#### 1. BaseApp

First up, we have the BaseApp. The baseapp is the standard implementation of a Cosmos SDK application. It provides an implementation of ABCI to handle connections to the underlying consensus engine. Typically, Cosmos SDK applications extend baseapp by including it in their app.go file (so that each developer doesn't have to create their own ABCI implementation).

Here's an example from the Cosmos SDK demo application, simapp:
(We're not going to go into the details here, just let your eyes get used to it like last time!)

```go
// SimApp extends an ABCI application, but with most of its parameters exported.
// They are exported for convenience in creating helper functions, as object
// capabilities aren't needed for testing.
type SimApp struct {
	*baseapp.BaseApp
	legacyAmino       *codec.LegacyAmino
	appCodec          codec.Codec
	txConfig          client.TxConfig
	interfaceRegistry types.InterfaceRegistry

	// keys to access the substores
	keys  map[string]*storetypes.KVStoreKey
	tkeys map[string]*storetypes.TransientStoreKey

	// keepers
	AccountKeeper         authkeeper.AccountKeeper
	BankKeeper            bankkeeper.Keeper
	StakingKeeper         *stakingkeeper.Keeper
	SlashingKeeper        slashingkeeper.Keeper
	MintKeeper            mintkeeper.Keeper
	DistrKeeper           distrkeeper.Keeper
	GovKeeper             govkeeper.Keeper
	CrisisKeeper          *crisiskeeper.Keeper
	UpgradeKeeper         *upgradekeeper.Keeper
	ParamsKeeper          paramskeeper.Keeper
	AuthzKeeper           authzkeeper.Keeper
	EvidenceKeeper        evidencekeeper.Keeper
	FeeGrantKeeper        feegrantkeeper.Keeper
	GroupKeeper           groupkeeper.Keeper
	NFTKeeper             nftkeeper.Keeper
	ConsensusParamsKeeper consensusparamkeeper.Keeper
	CircuitKeeper         circuitkeeper.Keeper

	// the module manager
	ModuleManager      *module.Manager
	BasicModuleManager module.BasicManager

	// simulation manager
	sm *module.SimulationManager

	// module configurator
	configurator module.Configurator
}
```

#### 2. Multistore

The Cosmos SDK provides multistores to persistently store the state of the blockchain.

Multistore means that developers can declare as many KVStores as they want.
(Depending on your AppChain development implementation, you can allocate and use as many stores as you want from the kvstores).

These KVStores only accept the `[]byte` type as a value, so you'll need to use a codec to marshal your custom structure before storing it. Multistore state is separate from blocks and is managed by each module, see the store article for more information.

#### 3. Modules

The strength of the Cosmos SDK is its modularity, and based on the architecture we learned about above, the Cosmos SDK is responsible for routing each message to the appropriate module.

Cosmos SDK applications, called appchains, are created by assembling multiple modules and declaring them in `app.go`. Previously, custom modules were implemented in one appchain, but recently, each module is separated into a library for portability.

Each module must basically satisfy the interface defined by the Cosmos SDK. The module itself defines a subset of the module state and implements its own `Messages/Transactions` processes.
(This will make sense later when we look at the code level, but just remember that each module must conform to the basic module interface defined by the Cosmos-SDK).

Each module can be viewed as a small state machine. Developers need to define the subset of state that the module handles and the custom message types that modify the state, and typically each module declares its own KVStore in the multistore to persistently store the defined subset of state.
(AppChain developers like us declare our own kvstore in the root multistore, so in effect we can CRUD into an abstracted structure called store from within our module).

In addition, some modules need access to other third-party modules. Therefore, security principles for interaction between modules are needed, and instead of maintaining access control lists for other modules, each module implements and uses something called a `keeper`, a special object that can be passed to other modules. We'll cover this in more detail in the Modules part!

Oh, and last but not least, by default, the modules built into the SDK are defined in the x/ folder of the Cosmos SDK, which is legacy!

If you take a quick look at [this link](https://github.com/Ludium-Official/ludiumapp-chain) to see the repository's organization, you'll understand.

### Overview App Chain Architecture

We'll end the article with an architecture that summarizes what we've learned in this lesson. I recommend watching this [video](https://youtu.be/1_ottIKPfI4?si=XstKA2YGi2-yYKzF) to understand the architecture.

(I won't watch it if you don't... but at least familiarize yourself with the schematic below! 👀 👀 👀 👀)
